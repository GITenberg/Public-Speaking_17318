<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>SPEECH</h3>


<p><b>Importance of Speech.</b> There never has been in
the history of the world a time when the spoken word
has been equaled in value and importance by any
other means of communication. If one traces the
development of mankind from what he considers its
earliest stage he will find that the wandering family
of savages depended entirely upon what its members
said to one another. A little later when a group of
families made a clan or tribe the individuals still
heard the commands of the leader, or in tribal council
voiced their own opinions. The beginnings of poetry
show us the bard who recited to his audiences. Drama,
in all primitive societies a valuable spreader of knowledge,
entertainment, and religion, is entirely oral.
In so late and well-organized communities as the
city republics of Greece all matters were discussed
in open assemblies of the rather small populations.</p>

<p>Every great epoch of the world's progress shows the
supreme importance of speech upon human action&mdash;individual
and collective. In the Roman Forum
were made speeches that affected the entire ancient
world. Renaissance Italy, imperial Spain, unwieldy
Russia, freedom-loving England, revolutionary France,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>all experienced periods when the power of certain men
to speak stirred other men into tempestuous action.</p>

<p>The history of the United States might almost be
written as the continuous record of the influence of
great speakers upon others. The colonists were led
to concerted action by persuasive speeches. The
Colonial Congresses and Constitutional Convention
were dominated by powerful orators. The history
of the slavery problem is mainly the story of famous
speeches and debates. Most of the active representative
Americans have been leaders because of their
ability to impress their fellows by their power
of expressing sentiments and enthusiasms which all
would voice if they could. Presidents have been
nominated and candidates elected because of this
equipment.</p>

<p>During the Great War the millions of the world
were as much concerned with what some of their
leaders were saying as with what their other leaders
were doing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See <i>Great American Speeches</i>, edited by Clarence Stratton, Lippincott
and Company.</p></div>

<p><b>Speech in Modern Life</b>. There is no aspect of
modern life in which the spoken work is not supreme
in importance. Representatives of the nations of
the world deciding upon a peace treaty and deliberating
upon a League of Nations sway and are swayed
by speech. National assemblies&mdash;from the strangely
named new ones of infant nations to the century-old
organizations&mdash;speak, and listen to speeches. In
state legislatures, municipal councils, law courts,
religious organizations, theaters, lodges, societies,
boards of directors, stockholders' meetings, business
discussions, classrooms, dinner parties, social functions,
friendly calls&mdash;in every human relationship
where two people meet there is communication by
means of speech.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>Scientific invention keeps moving as rapidly as it
can to take advantage of this supreme importance.
Great as was the advance marked by the telegraph,
it was soon overtaken and passed by the convenience
of the telephone. The first conveys messages at
great distance, but it fails to give the answer at once.
It fails to provide for the rapid <i>interchange</i> of ideas
which the second affords. Wireless telegraphy has
already been followed by wireless telephony. The
rapid intelligent disposal of the complicated affairs
of our modern world requires more than mere writing&mdash;it
demands immediate interchange of ideas by means
of speech.</p>

<p>Many people who in their habitual occupations
are popularly said to write a great deal do nothing
of the sort. The millions of typists in the world do
no writing at all in the real sense of that word; they
merely reproduce what some one else has actually
composed and dictated. This latter person also does
no actual writing. He speaks what he wants to have
put into writing. Dictating is not an easily acquired
accomplishment in business&mdash;as many a man will
testify. Modern office practice has intensified the
difficulty. It may be rather disconcerting to deliver
well-constructed, meaningful sentences to an unresponsive
stenographer, but at any rate the receiver
is alive. But to talk into the metallic receiver of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>mechanical dictaphone has an almost ridiculous air.
Men have to train themselves deliberately to speak
well when they first begin to use these time-saving
devices. Outside of business, a great deal of the
material printed in periodicals and books&mdash;sometimes
long novels&mdash;has been delivered orally, and
not written at all by its author. Were anything
more needed to show how much speech is used it
would be furnished by the reports of the telephone
companies. In one table the number of daily connections
in 1895 was 2,351,420. In 1918 this item
had increased to 31,263,611. In twenty-three years
the calls had grown fifteen times as numerous. In 1882
there were 100,000 subscriber stations. In 1918 this
number had swelled to 11,000,000.</p>

<p>Subordinates and executives in all forms of business
could save incalculable time and annoyance by being
able to present their material clearly and forcefully
over the telephone, as well as in direct face-to-face
intercourse.</p>

<p>The Director of high schools in a large municipality
addressed a circular letter to the business firms of
the city, asking them to state what is most necessary
in order to fit boys for success in business. Ninety-nine
per cent laid stress on the advantage of being
able to write and speak English accurately and forcibly.</p>

<p>Testimony in support of the statement that training
in speaking is of paramount importance in all careers
might be adduced from a score of sources. Even from
the seemingly far-removed phase of military leadership
comes the same support. The following paragraph
is part of a letter issued by the office of the Adjutant-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>General
during the early months of the participation
of this country in the Great War.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A great number of men have failed at camp because of
inability to articulate clearly. A man who cannot impart
his idea to his command in clear distinct language, and with
sufficient volume of voice to be heard reasonably far, is not
qualified to give command upon which human life will
depend. Many men disqualified by this handicap might
have become officers under their country's flag had they
been properly trained in school and college. It is to be
hoped therefore that more emphasis will be placed upon
the basic principles of elocution in the training of our youth.
Even without prescribed training in elocution a great improvement
could be wrought by the instructors in our
schools and colleges, regardless of the subjects, by insisting
that all answers be given in a loud, clear, well rounded voice
which, of course, necessitates the opening of the mouth and
free movement of the lips. It is remarkable how many
excellent men suffer from this handicap, and how almost
impossible it is to correct this after the formative years of
life."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the most concise summary of the relative
values of exercise in the three different forms of communication
through language was enunciated by
Francis Bacon in his essay entitled <i>Studies</i>, published
first in 1597: "Reading maketh a full man; conference
a ready man; and writing an exact man."</p>

<p><b>Speech and Talk.</b> The high value here placed upon
speech must not be transferred to mere talk. The
babbler will always be justly regarded with contempt.
Without ideas, opinions, information, talk becomes
the most wasteful product in the world, wasteful not
only of the time of the person who insists upon deliver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>ing
it, but more woefully and unjustifiably wasteful
of the time and patience of those poor victims who
are forced to listen to it. Shakespeare put a man
of this disposition into <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and
then had his discourse described by another.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than
any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of
wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day
'ere you find them, and when you have them, they are not
worth the search."</p></div>

<p>But the man who has ideas and can best express
them is a leader everywhere. He does the organizing,
he makes and imparts the plans, he carries his own
theories and beliefs into execution, he is the intrusted
agent, the advanced executive. He can act for himself.
He can influence others to significant and purposeful
action. The advantages that come to men
who can think upon their feet, who can express extempore
a carefully considered proposition, who can
adapt their conversation or arguments to every changing
condition, cannot be emphasized too strongly.</p>

<p><b>Speech an Acquired Ability.</b> We frequently regard
and discuss speech as a perfectly natural attribute of
all human beings. In some sense it is. Yet an
American child left to the care of deaf-mutes, never
hearing the speech of his own kind, would not develop
into a speaker of the native language of his parents.
He doubtless would be able to imitate every natural
sound he might hear. He could reproduce the cry
or utterance of every animal or bird he had ever heard.
But he would no more speak English naturally than
he would Arabic. In this sense, language is not a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>natural attribute as is hunger. It is an imitative accomplishment
acquired only after long years of patient
practice and arduous effort. Some people never
really attain a facile mastery of the means of communication.
Some mature men and women are no
more advanced in the use of speech than children of
ten or fifteen. The practice is life-long. The effort
is unceasing.</p>

<p>A child seems to be as well adapted to learning one
language as another. There may be certain physical
formations or powers inherited from a race which predispose
the easier mastery of a language, but even these
handicaps for learning a different tongue can be overcome
by imitation, study, and practice. Any child
can be taught an alien tongue through constant companionship
of nurse or governess. The second generation
of immigrants to this country learns our
speech even while it may continue the tongue of the
native land. The third generation&mdash;if it mix continuously
with speakers of English&mdash;relinquishes
entirely the exercise of the mother tongue. The succeeding
generation seldom can speak it, frequently
cannot even understand it.</p>

<p><b>Training to Acquire Speech Ability.</b> The methods
by which older persons may improve their ability to
speak are analogous to those just suggested as operative
for children, except that the more mature the person
the wider is his range of models to imitate, of examples
from which to make deductions; the more resources
he has within himself and about him for self-development
and improvement. A child's vocabulary increases
rapidly through new experiences. A mature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>person can create new surroundings. He can deliberately
widen his horizon either by reading or
association. The child is mentally alert. A man
can keep himself intellectually alert. A child delights
in his use of his powers of expression. A man can
easily make his intercourse a source of delight to himself
and to all with whom he comes in contact. A
child's imagination is kept stimulated continually.
A man can consciously stimulate either his imagination
or his reason. In the democracy of childhood the
ability to impress companions depends to a great
extent upon the ability to speak. There is no necessity
of following the parallel any farther.</p>

<p>Good speakers, then, are made, not born. Training
counts for as much as natural ability. In fact if
a person considers carefully the careers of men whose
ability to speak has impressed the world by its preeminence
he will incline to the conclusion that the
majority of them were not to any signal extent born
speakers at all. In nearly all cases of great speakers
who have left records of their own progress in this
powerful art their testimony is that without the
effort to improve, without the unceasing practice they
would have always remained no more marked for
this so-called gift than all others.</p>

<p><b>Overcoming Drawbacks.</b> According to the regularly
repeated tradition the great Greek orator, Demosthenes,
overcame impediments that would have
daunted any ordinary man. His voice was weak.
He lisped, and his manner was awkward. With
pebbles in his mouth he tried his lungs against the
noise of the dashing waves. This strengthened his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>voice and gave him presence of mind in case of tumult
among his listeners. He declaimed as he ran uphill.
Whether these traditions be true or not, their basis
must be that it was only by rigorous training that
he did become a tolerable speaker. The significant
point, however, is that with apparent handicaps he
did develop his ability until he became great.</p>

<p>Charles James Fox began his parliamentary career
by being decidedly awkward and filling his speeches
with needless repetitions, yet he became renowned as one
of Great Britain's most brilliant speakers and statesmen.</p>

<p>Henry Clay clearly describes his own exercises in
self-training when he was quite a grown man.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I owe my success in life to one single fact, namely, at the
age of twenty-seven I commenced, and continued for years,
the practice of daily reading and speaking upon the contents
of some historical or scientific book. These offhand
efforts were made sometimes in a corn field, at others in the
forests, and not infrequently in some distant barn with the
horse and ox for my auditors. It is to this early practice
in the art of all arts that I am indebted to the primary and
leading impulses that stimulated me forward, and shaped
and molded my entire destiny."</p></div>

<p>Abraham Lincoln never let pass any opportunity
to try to make a speech. His early employers, when
called upon after his fame was won to describe his
habits as a young man, admitted that they might have
been disposed to consider him an idle fellow. They
explained that he was not only idle himself but the
cause of idleness in others. Unless closely watched,
he was likely to mount a stump and, to the intense
delight of his fellow farm hands, deliver a side-splitting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>imitation of some itinerant preacher or a stirring
political harangue.</p>

<p>The American whose reputation for speech is the
greatest won it more through training than by natural
gift.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I could not speak before the school," said Daniel Webster.
... "Many a piece did I commit to memory and rehearse
in my room over and over again, but when the day came,
and the schoolmaster called my name, and I saw all eyes
turned upon my seat, I could not raise myself from it....
Mr. Buckminster always pressed and entreated, most winningly,
that I would venture, but I could never command
sufficient resolution. When the occasion was over I went
home and wept bitter tears of mortification."</p></div>

<p><b>Results of Training.</b> The significance of all these
illustrations is that no great speaker has come by his
ability without careful and persistent training. No
molder of the world's destinies springs fully equipped
from the welter of promiscuous events. He has been
training for a long time. On the other hand the much
more practical lesson to be derived from these biographical
excerpts is that these men started from
ordinary conditions to make themselves into forceful
thinkers with powers of convincing expression. They
overcame handicaps. They strengthened their voices.
They learned how to prepare and arrange material.
They made themselves able to explain topics to others.
They knew so well the reasons for their own belief
that they could convince others.</p>

<p>In a smaller way, to a lesser degree, any person can
do the same thing, and by the same or similar methods.
Barring some people who have physical defects or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>nervous diseases, any person who has enough brains
to grasp an idea, to form an opinion, or to produce a
thought, can be made to speak well. The preceding
sentence says "barring some people who have physical
defects" because not all so handicapped at the beginning
need despair of learning to improve in speaking
ability. By systems in which the results appear
almost miraculous the dumb are now taught to speak.
Stutterers and stammerers become excellent deliverers
of speeches in public. Weak voices are strengthened.
Hesitant expressions are made coherent. Such marvels
of modern science belong, however, to special classes
and institutions. They are cited here to prove that
in language training today practically nothing is
impossible to the teacher with knowledge and patience
in educating students with alertness and persistence.</p>

<p><b>Practical Help.</b> This book attempts to provide a
guide for such teachers and students. It aims to be
eminently practical. It is intended to help students
to improve in speech. It assumes that those who
use it are able to speak their language with some
facility&mdash;at least they can pronounce its usual words.
That and the realization that one is alive, as indicated
by a mental openness to ideas and an intellectual
alertness about most things in the universe, are all
that are absolutely required of a beginner who tries
to improve in speaking. Practically all else can be
added unto him.</p>

<p>As this volume has a definite aim it has a simple
practical basis. It will not soar too far above the
essentials. It tries not to offer an elaborate explanation
of an enthymeme when the embryonic speaker's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>knees are knocking together so loudly that he can
not hear the instructor's correcting pronunciation
of the name. It takes into account that when a
beginner stands before an audience&mdash;and this is
true not only the first time&mdash;even his body is not
under his control. Lips grow cold and dry; perspiration
gushes from every pore of the brow and
runs down the face; legs grow weak; eyes see nothing;
hands swell to enormous proportions; violent pains
shoot across the chest; the breath is confined within
the lungs; from the clapper-like tongue comes only
a faint click. Is it any wonder that under such physical
agonies the mind refuses to respond&mdash;rather, is
incapable of any action whatever?</p>

<p><b>Speech Based on Thought and Language.</b> Every
speech is a result of the combination of thought and
language, of material and expression. It would be
quite possible to begin with considerations of the
thought content of speeches&mdash;the material; but
this book begins with the other;&mdash;the language, the
expression. If this order have no other advantage,
it does possess this one;&mdash;that during the informal
discussions and expressions of opinion occasioned
by the early chapters and exercises, members of the
class are attaining a feeling of ease in speaking among
themselves which will later eradicate a great deal of
the nervousness usually experienced when speaking
<i>before</i> the class. In addition, some attention to such
topics as voice, tone, pronunciation, common errors,
use of the dictionary, vocabulary, may instil habits
of self-criticism and observation which may save
from doubt and embarrassing mistakes later.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE VOICE</h3>


<p><b>Organs of Speech.</b> Although the effects produced
by the human voice are myriad in their complexity,
the apparatus involved in making the sounds which
constitute speech is extremely simple. In construction
it has been usually compared to an organ pipe,
a comparison justifiable for imparting a non-technical
understanding of its operation.</p>

<p>An organ pipe is a tube in which a current of air
passing over the edge of a piece of metal causes it to
vibrate, thus putting into motion the column of air
in the pipe which then produces a note. The operating
air is forced across the sounding piece of metal from a
bellows. The tube in which the thin sounding plate
and the column of air vibrate acts as a resonator. The
resulting sound depends upon various sizes of the
producing parts. If the tube is quite long the sound
is low in pitch. If the tube is short the sound is
high. Stopping the end of the pipe or leaving it
open alters the pitch. A stopped pipe gives a note
an octave lower than an open pipe of the same
length. The amount of the vibrating plate which
is allowed to move also determines the pitch of
a note. If the air is under great pressure the note
is loud. If the air is under little pressure the note
is soft.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite easy to transfer this explanation to the
voice-producing apparatus in the human body.</p>

<p>To the bellows correspond the lungs from which the
expelled air is forced upwards through the windpipe.
The lungs are able to expel air regularly and
gently, with no more expense of energy than ordinary
breathing requires. But the lungs can also force
air out with tremendous power&mdash;power enough
to carry sound over hundreds of yards. In
ordinary repose the outward moving breath produces
no sound whatever, for it meets in its passage
no obstruction.</p>

<p><b>Producing Tone.</b> At the upper end of the windpipe
is a triangular chamber, the front angle of which
forms the Adam's apple. In this are the vocal cords.
These cords are two tapes of membrane which can
be brought closely together, and by muscular tension
stretched until passing air causes them to vibrate.
They in turn cause the air above them to vibrate,
much as the air in an organ pipe vibrates. Thus
tone is produced.</p>

<p>The air above the vocal cords may fill all the open
spaces above the larynx&mdash;the throat, the mouth, the
nasal cavity in the head, the nostrils. This rather
large amount of air, vibrating freely, produces a sound
low in pitch. The larger the cavities are made the
lower the pitch. You can verify this by producing
a note. Then place your finger upon your Adam's
apple. Produce a sound lower in pitch. Notice what
your larynx does. Sing a few notes down the scale
or up to observe the same principle of the change of
pitch in the human voice.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Producing Vowels.</b> If the mouth be kept wide
open and no other organ be allowed to modify or
interrupt the sound a vowel is produced. In speech
every part of the head that can be used is brought
into action to modify these uninterrupted vibrations
of vocal cords and air. The lips, the cheeks, the
teeth, the tongue, the hard palate, the soft palate,
the nasal cavity, all co&ouml;perate to make articulate
speech.</p>

<p>As in its mechanism, so in the essence of its modifications,
the human voice is a marvel of simplicity.
If the mouth be opened naturally and the tongue and
lips be kept as much out of the way as in ordinary
breathing, and then the vocal cords be made to vibrate,
the resulting sound will be the vowel <i>a</i> as in <i>father</i>.
If now, starting from that same position and with
that same vowel sound, the tongue be gradually raised
the sound will be modified. Try it. The sound will
pass through other vowels. Near the middle position
it will sound like <i>a</i> in <i>fate</i>; and when the tongue gets
quite close to the roof of the mouth without touching
it the vowel will be the <i>e</i> of <i>feet</i>. Others&mdash;such as
the <i>i</i> of <i>it</i>&mdash;can be distinguished clearly.</p>

<p>Starting again from that same open position and with
that same vowel sound, <i>ah</i>, if the tongue be allowed
to lie flat, but the lips be gradually closed and at the
same time rounded, the sound will pass from <i>ah</i> to
the <i>o</i> of <i>hope</i>, then on to the <i>oo</i> of <i>troop</i>. The <i>oa</i> of
<i>broad</i> and other vowels can be distinguished at various
positions.</p>

<p>By moving lips and tongue at the same time an
almost infinite variety of vowel sounds can be made.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Producing Consonants.</b> In order to produce consonant
sounds the other parts of the speaking apparatus
are brought into operation. Everyone of
them has some function in the formation of some
consonant by interrupting or checking the breath.
A student, by observing or feeling the motions of his
mouth can easily instruct himself in the importance
of each part if he will carefully pronounce a few times
all the various consonant sounds of the language.</p>

<p>The lips produce the sounds of <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>wh</i>, and <i>w</i>.
The lips and teeth produce the sounds of <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>. The
tongue and teeth together make the sounds of <i>th</i> and
<i>dh</i>. The tongue in conjunction with the forward
portion of the hard palate produces several sounds&mdash;<i>t</i>,
<i>d</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>l</i>. The tongue operating against or
near the rear of the hard palate pronounces <i>ch</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>sh</i>,
<i>zh</i>, and a different <i>r</i>. To make the consonant <i>y</i> the
tongue, the hard palate, and the soft palate operate.
The tongue and soft palate make <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>. A strong
breathing makes the sound of <i>h</i>. By including the
nasal passages in conjunction with some of the other
parts here listed the so-called nasals, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, and <i>ng</i>,
are made. According to the organ involved our consonant
sounds are conveniently grouped as labials
(lips), dentals (teeth), linguals (tongue), palatals
(palate), and nasals (nose).</p>

<p>The correct position and action of the vocal organs
are of supreme importance to all speakers. Many
an inveterate stammerer, stutterer, or repeater can
be relieved, if not cured, of the embarrassing impediment
by attention to the position of his speech organs
and by careful, persistent practice in their manipula<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>tion.
In fact every speaker must be cognizant of
the placement of these parts if he desires to have
control over his speech. Frequently it is such correct
placement rather than loud noise or force which carries
expressions clearly to listeners.</p>

<p>While it is true that singing will strengthen the
lungs and help in control of breath, it is not always the
fact&mdash;as might be expected&mdash;that singing will develop
the speaking voice. Not every person who can
sing has a pleasant or forceful voice in ordinary discourse.
In singing, to secure purity of musical tone,
the vowels are likely to be disproportionately dwelt
upon. Thus we have the endless <i>la-la-la</i> and <i>ah-ah</i>
of so many vocal show-pieces. The same practice
leads to the repeated criticism that it makes no difference
whether a song be in English or a foreign
language&mdash;the listeners understand just as much in
either case.</p>

<p>In speaking effectively the aim and method are the
exact opposite. When a man speaks he wants to be
listened to for the meaning of what he is uttering.
There are so many words in the language with the
same or similar vowel sounds that only the sharpest
discrimination by means of consonants permits of
their being intelligible. The speaker, therefore, will
exercise the greatest care in pronouncing consonants
distinctly. As these sounds usually begin and end
words, and as they are produced by rather sudden
checks or interruptions, they can be made to produce
a wave motion in the air which will carry the entire
word safely and clearly beyond the ear into the understanding.
In public speaking no amount of care and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>attention bestowed upon pronouncing consonants can
be spared.</p>

<p><b>Tone.</b> The most marked quality of a person's
voice is its tone. It will be enough for the purposes
of this manual to assert that the tone should be both
clear and agreeable. In public speaking the first of
these is all important, though an absence of the second
qualification may almost neutralize all the advantages
of the first. Clearness may be impaired by several
causes. The speaker may feel that his throat closes
up, that he becomes choked. His tongue may become
stiff and "cleave to the roof of his mouth"&mdash;as
the feeling is popularly described. He may breathe
so energetically that the escaping or entering air makes
more noise than the words themselves. He may be
more or less conscious of all these. The others he may
not discover for himself. The instructor or members
of the class will inform him of their presence. Set
jaws will prevent him from opening his mouth wide
enough and operating his lips flexibly enough to
speak with a full tone. A nasal quality results mainly
from lack of free resonance in the head and nose
passages. Adenoids and colds in the head produce
this condition. It should be eradicated by advice
and practice.</p>

<p>Usually whatever corrections will make the tone
clearer will also make it more agreeable. The nasal
pessimistic whine is not a pleasant recommendation
of personality. High, forced, strident tones produce
not only irritation in the listener but throat trouble
for the speaker.</p>

<p>Articulate&mdash;that is, connected&mdash;speech may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>considered with reference to four elements, all of which
are constantly present in any spoken discourse.</p>

<p><b>Speed.</b> First, there is the speed of delivery. An
angry woman can utter more words in a minute than
any one wants to hear. The general principle underlying
all speech delivery is that as the audience increases
in number the rapidity of utterance should
be lessened. Those who are accustomed to addressing
large audiences, or to speaking in the open air,
speak very slowly. A second consideration is the
material being delivered. Easily grasped narrative,
description, and explanation, simply phrased and
directly constructed, may be delivered much more
rapidly than involved explanation, unfamiliar phraseology,
long and intricate sentence constructions, unusual
material, abstract reasoning, and unwelcome
sentiments. The beginnings of speeches move much
more slowly than later parts. A speaker who intends
to lead an audience a long distance, or to hold the
attention for a long time, will be extremely careful
not to speak at the beginning so rapidly that he leaves
them far behind.</p>

<p>This does not mean that a speaker must drawl his
words. One of our national characteristics is that we
shorten our words in pronouncing them&mdash;<i>ing</i> generally
loses the <i>g, does not</i> has become <i>doesn't</i> and
quite incorrectly <i>don't, yes</i> is <i>yeeh</i>, etc. In many
cases nothing more is required than the restoration of
the word to its correct form. Some words can easily
be lengthened because of the significance of their
meanings. Others must be extended in order to
carry. The best method of keeping down the rate of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>delivery is by a judicious use of pauses. Pauses are
to the listener what punctuation marks are to the
reader. He is not conscious of their presence, but he
would be left floundering if they were absent. Some
of the most effective parts of speeches are the pauses.
They impart clearness to ideas, as well as aiding in
emphasis and rhythm.</p>

<p><b>Pitch.</b> A second quality of speech is its pitch.
This simply means its place in the musical scale.
Speaking voices are high, medium, or low. Unfortunate
tendencies of Americans seem to be for
women to pitch their voices too high, with resultant
strain and unpleasantness, and for men to pitch their
voices too low, with resultant growls and gruffness.
The voices of young children should be carefully
guarded in this respect; so should the changing voices
of growing boys. To secure a good pitch for the
speaking voice the normal natural pitch of usual conversation
should be found. Speech in that same
pitch should be developed for larger audiences. Frequently
a better pitch can be secured by slightly
lowering the voice. If the natural pitch be too low
for clearness or agreeableness it should be slightly
raised&mdash;never more than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>No connected group of words should be delivered
in a monotonously level pitch. The voice must rise
and fall. These changes must answer intelligently
to the meaning of the material. Such variations are
called inflections. The most disagreeable violations
of required inflections are raising the voice where
it should fall&mdash;as at the completion of an idea, and
letting it drop where it should remain up&mdash;as before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>the completion of an idea, frequently answering to a
comma. Other variations of pitch depend upon
emphasis.</p>

<p><b>Emphasis.</b> Emphasis is giving prominence to a
word or phrase so that its importance is impressed
upon a listener. This result is most easily secured
by contrast. More force may be put into its delivery
than the rest of the speech. The word may be made
louder or not so loud. The voice may be pitched
higher or lower. The word may be lengthened.
Pauses will make it prominent. In speaking, combinations
of these are employed to produce emphasis.</p>

<p>While all qualities of speech are important, emphasis
is of cardinal value. Listeners will never
recall everything that a speaker has said. By a
skilful employment of emphasis he will put into their
consciousness the main theme of his message, the
salient arguments of his contention, the leading motives
of action. Here again is that close interdependence
of manner and material referred to in the
preceding chapter. In later chapters will be discussed
various methods of determining and securing emphasis
of larger sections than mere words and phrases.</p>

<p><b>Phrasing.</b> Somewhat related to emphasis is phrasing.
This is the grouping together of words, phrases,
clauses, and other units so that their meaning and
significance may be easily grasped by a listener. As
has been already said, pauses serve as punctuation
marks for the hearer. Short pauses correspond to
commas, longer ones to colons and semi-colons, marked
ones to periods. Speakers can by pauses clearly
indicate the conclusions of sections, the completion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>of topics, the passage from one part of the material
to another, the transfer of attention from one subject
to its opposite. Within smaller range pauses can add
delightful variety to delivery as they can signally
reinforce the interpretation. No speaker should fall
into the habit of monotonously letting his pauses
mark the limit of his breath capacity, nor should he
take any regular phrase, clause, or sentence length to
be indicated by pauses. In this as in all other aspects
variety is the charm of speech.</p>

<p><b>Enunciation.</b> No matter what handicaps a person
may have he may overcome them to secure a distinct,
agreeable enunciation. Care in enunciating words
will enable a speaker to be heard almost anywhere.
It is recorded that John Fox, a famous preacher of
South Place Chapel, London, whose voice was neither
loud nor strong, was heard in every part of Covent
Garden Theatre, seating 3500, when he made anti-corn-law
orations, by the clearness with which he
pronounced the final consonants of the words he
spoke.</p>

<p>One of the orators best known to readers is Edmund
Burke, whose speeches are studied as models of argumentative
arrangement and style. Yet in actual
speech-making Burke was more or less a failure because
of the unfortunate method of his delivery. Many
men markedly inferior in capacity to Burke overcame
disadvantageous accidents, but he was frequently
hurried and impetuous. Though his tones were
naturally sonorous, they were harsh; and he never
divested his speech of a strong Irish accent. Then,
too, his gestures were clumsy. These facts will ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>plain
to us who read and study leisurely these masterpieces
why they failed of their purpose when presented
by their gifted but ineffective author.</p>

<p><b>Pronunciation.</b> Enunciation depends to a great
degree upon pronunciation. The pronunciation of
a word is no fixed and unchangeable thing. Every
district of a land may have its peculiar local sounds,
every succeeding generation may vary the manner
of accenting a word. English people today pronounce
<i>schedule</i> with a soft <i>ch</i> sound. <i>Program</i> has
had its accent shifted from the last to the first syllable.
Many words have two regularly heard pronunciations&mdash;<i>neither,
advertisement, Elizabethan, rations,
oblique, route, quinine</i>, etc. Fashions come and go
in pronunciation as in all other human interests. Some
sounds stamp themselves as carelessnesses or perversions
at once and are never admitted into educated,
cultured speech. Others thrive and have their day,
only to fade before some more widely accepted pronunciation.
The first rule in pronunciation is to
consult a good dictionary. This will help in most
cases but not in all, for a dictionary merely records
all accepted sounds; only partly can it point out the
better of disputed sounds by placing it first. Secondly,
speech is a living, growing, changing thing. Dictionaries
drop behind the times surprisingly rapidly.
The regularly accepted sound may have come into
general use after the dictionary was printed. New
activities, unusual phases of life may throw into general
conversation thousands of unused, unheard words.
This was true of the recent Great War, when with
little or no preparation thousands of military, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>dustrial,
naval, and aeronautical terms came into
daily use. Discussions still flutter mildly around
<i>cantonment</i> and <i>rations</i>, and a score of others.</p>

<p>Next to authoritative books, the best models are
to be secured from the speech of authorities in each
branch to which the term specifically belongs. Thus
the military leaders have made the pronunciation of
<i>oblique</i> with the long <i>i</i> the correct one for all military
usages. The accepted sound of <i>cantonments</i> was
fixed by the men who built and controlled them. As
it is not always possible for the ordinary person to
hear such authorities deliver such terms in discourse
one can merely say that a familiarity with correct
pronunciation can be secured only like liberty&mdash;at
the price of eternal vigilance.</p>

<p>Constant consultation of the dictionary and other
books of recognized reference value, close observance
of the speech of others, scrutiny of one's own pronunciation,
mental criticism of others' slips, and
determination to correct one's own errors, are the
various methods of attaining certainty of correct
delivery of word sounds.</p>

<p><b>Poise.</b> When a speaker stands before an audience
to address its members he should be perfectly at ease.
Physical ease will produce an effect upon the listeners.
Mental ease because of mastery of the material will
induce confidence in the delivery. Bodily eccentricities
and awkwardness which detract from the
speech itself should be eradicated by strenuous practice.
Pose and poise should first command respectful
attention. The body should be erect, but not stiff.
Most of the muscles should be relaxed. The feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>should be naturally placed, not so far apart as to
suggest straddling, not so close together as to suggest
the military stand at "attention."</p>

<p>What should be done with the hands? Nothing.
They should not be clasped; they should not be put
behind the back; they should not be jammed into
pockets; the arms should not be held akimbo; they
should not be folded. Merely let the arms and hands
hang at the sides naturally.</p>

<p><b>Gestures.</b> Should a speaker make gestures? Certainly
never if the gesture detracts from the force of
an expression, as when a preacher pounds the book
so hard that the congregation cannot hear his words.
Certainly yes, when the feeling of the speaker behind
the phrase makes him enforce his meaning by a suitable
movement. In speaking today fewer gestures are
indulged in than years ago. There should never be
many. Senseless, jerky, agitated pokings and twitchings
should be eradicated completely. Insincere flourishes
should be inhibited. Beginners should beware
of gestures until they become such practised masters
of their minds and bodies that physical emphasis may
be added to spoken force.</p>

<p>A speaker should feel perfectly free to change his
position or move his feet during his remarks. Usually
such a change should be made to correspond with a
pause in delivery. In this way it reinforces the indication
of progress or change of topic, already cited
in discussing pauses.</p>

<p><b>Delivery.</b> A speaker should never begin to talk
the very instant he has taken his place before his
audience. He should make a slight pause to collect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>the attention before he utters his salutation (to be
considered later) and should make another short
pause between it and the opening sentences of his
speech proper. After he has spoken the last word
he should not fling away from his station to his seat.
This always spoils the effect of an entire address by
ruining the impression that the last phrase might
have made.</p>

<p>As for the speech itself, there are five ways of delivering
it:</p>

<p>1. To write it out in full and read it.</p>

<p>2. To write it out in full and commit it to memory.</p>

<p>3. To write out and memorize the opening and
closing sentences and other especially important
parts, leaving the rest for extempore
delivery.</p>

<p>4. To use an outline or a brief which suggests
the headings in logical order.</p>

<p>5. To speak without manuscript or notes.</p>

<p><b>Reading the Speech.</b> The first of these methods&mdash;to
read the speech from a prepared manuscript&mdash;really
changes the speech to a lecture or reading.
True, it prevents the author from saying anything
he would not say in careful consideration of his topic.
It assures him of getting in all he wants to say. It
gives the impression that all his utterances are the
result of calm, collected thinking. On the other hand,
so few people can read from a manuscript convincingly
that the reproduction is likely to be a dull, lifeless
proceeding in which almost anything might be said,
so little does the material impress the audience. This
method can hardly be considered speech-making at all.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Memorizing the Speech.</b> The second method&mdash;of
repeating memorized compositions&mdash;is better. It
at least seems alive. It has an appearance of direct
address. It possesses the other advantages of the
first method&mdash;definite reasoning and careful construction.
But its dangers are grave. Few people
can recite memorized passages with the personal
appeal and direct significance that effective spoken
discourse should have. Emphasis is lacking. Variety
is absent. The tone becomes monotonous. The speech
is so well committed that it flows too easily. If several
speakers follow various methods, almost any listener
can unerringly pick the memorized efforts. Let the
speaker in delivery strive for variety, pauses, emphasis;
let him be actor enough to simulate the feeling
of spontaneous composition as he talks, yet no matter
how successful he may be in his attempts there will
still be slight inconsistencies, trifling incongruities,
which will disturb a listener even if he cannot describe
his mental reaction. The secret lies in the fact that
written and spoken composition differ in certain
details which are present in each form in spite of the
utmost care to weed them out.</p>

<p><b>Memorizing Parts.</b> The third manner can be
made effective if the speaker can make the gap just
described between written and spoken discourse extremely
narrow. If not, his speech will appear just
what it is&mdash;an incongruous patchwork of carefully
prepared, reconsidered writing, and more or less
spontaneously evolved speaking.</p>

<p><b>Speaking from Outline or Brief.</b> The fourth method
is by far the best for students training themselves to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>become public speakers. After a time the brief or
outline can be retained in the mind, and the speaker
passes from this method to the next. A brief for an
important law case in the United States Supreme
Court is a long and elaborate instrument. But
a student speaker's brief or outline need not be
long.</p>

<p>Directions, models, and exercises for constructing
and using outlines will be given in a later chapter.</p>

<p><b>The Best Method.</b> The last method is unquestionably
the best. Let a man so command all the
aspects of a subject that he fears no breakdown in
his thoughts, let him be able to use language so that
he need never hesitate for the best expression, let him
know the effect he wants to make upon his audience,
the time he has to do it in, and he will know by what
approaches he can best reach his important theme,
what he may safely omit, what he must include, what
he may hurry over, what he must slowly unfold, what
he may handle lightly, what he must treat seriously;
in short, he will make a great speech. This manner
is the ideal towards which all students, all speakers,
should strive.</p>

<p><b>Attributes of the Speaker.</b> Attributes of the speaker
himself will aid or mar his speech. Among those which
help are sincerity, earnestness, simplicity, fairness,
self-control, sense of humor, sympathy. All great
speakers have possessed these traits. Reports upon
significant speakers describing their manner emphasize
them. John Bright, the famous English parliamentarian
of the middle of the last century, is described as
follows:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>His style of speaking was exactly what a conventional
demagogue's ought not to be. It was pure to austerity; it
was stripped of all superfluous ornament. It never gushed
or foamed. It never allowed itself to be mastered by passion.
The first peculiarity that struck the listener was its superb
self-restraint. The orator at his most powerful passages
appeared as if he were rather keeping in his strength than
taxing it with effort.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Justin McCarthy:</span> <i>History of Our Own Time</i></p>
</div>

<p>In American history the greatest speeches were made
by Abraham Lincoln. In Cooper Union, New York,
he made in 1860 the most powerful speech against the
slave power. The <i>New York Tribune</i> the next day
printed this description of his manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Lincoln is one of nature's orators, using his rare
powers solely to elucidate and convince, though their inevitable
effect is to delight and electrify as well. We present
herewith a very full and accurate report of this speech; yet
the tones, the gestures, the kindling eye, and the mirth-provoking
look defy the reporter's skill. The vast assemblage
frequently rang with cheers and shouts of applause,
which were prolonged and intensified at the close. No man
ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a
New York audience.</p></div>

<p><b>Shakespeare's Advice.</b> Some of the best advice for
speakers was written by Shakespeare as long ago as
just after 1600, and although it was intended primarily
for actors, its precepts are just as applicable
to almost any kind of delivered discourse. Every
sentence of it is full of significance for a student of
speaking. Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is airing his
opinions about the proper manner of speaking upon
the stage.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>HAMLET'S SPEECH</p>

<p>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of
your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but
use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may
say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me
to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the
groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumb-shows and noise. I would have such a
fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-herods
Herod. Pray you, avoid it.</p>

<p>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be
your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the
action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature. For anything so overdone is from
the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now,
was and is, to hold, as 't were, the mirror up to nature; to
show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the
very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now
this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh
a whole theater of others. Oh, there be players that I have
seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to
speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians
nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's
journeymen had made men and not made them well, they
imitated humanity so abominably.</p>

<p>Oh, reform it altogether. And let those that play your
clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity
of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime
some necessary question of the play be then to be considered.
That's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.</p></div>

<h3>WORDS AND SENTENCES</h3>


<p><b>Vocabularies.</b> The collection of words a person
can command either in use or understanding is a
vocabulary. Every person has three distinct ones:
his reading vocabulary, his writing vocabulary, his
speaking vocabulary. Of these, the reading vocabulary
is the largest. There are thousands of words he
recognizes in reading and although he might not be
able to construct a dictionary definition for every
one, he has a sufficiently clear idea to grasp the meaning.
In this rude approximation to sense he is aided
by the context, but for all practical purposes he understands
the word. If he were writing, carefully taking
time to note exactly what he was expressing, he might
recall that word and so consciously put it into a sentence.
He might use it in exactly the same sense in
which he had seen it in print. But never in the rush
of ideas and words in spoken discourse would he risk
using a word he knew so slightly. If nothing more,
he would beware of mispronunciation.</p>

<p>Thus a person could easily deduce from his reading
that a <i>hangar</i> is a building to house airplanes. He
might&mdash;to avoid repeating the word <i>shed</i> too frequently&mdash;use
it in writing. But until he was absolutely
certain of its significance and its sound he would
hardly venture to say it to other men.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>Spoken discourse is so alive, it moves so rapidly,
that it is never so precise, so varied in its choice of
words, as written material. The phraseology of
written discourse sounds slightly or markedly stilted,
bookish, if repeated by the tongue. This difference&mdash;though
it may appear almost trifling&mdash;is apparent
to everyone. Its recognition can be partly illustrated
by the fact that after President Lowell and Senator
Lodge had debated on the topic, the League of Nations,
in Boston and were shown the reports of their speeches,
each made changes in certain expressions. The version
for print and reading is a little more formal than the
delivered sentences. The Senator said, "I want"
but preferred to write "I wish"; then he changed
"has got to be" into "must," and "nothing to see"
into "nothing visible."</p>

<p>One might say that all three vocabularies should
correspond, but there is no real need of this. So long
as people read they will meet thousands of words for
which they have no need in speaking. Everybody must
be able to understand the masterpieces of the past with
their archaic (old-fashioned) words like <i>eftsoons</i> or <i>halidom</i>,
but no one need use such expressions now. So
there is no discredit in the fact that one's speaking vocabulary
is more restricted than his reading vocabulary.</p>

<p><b>New Ideas, New Words.</b> It is true, however, that
an educated person should never rest content with
the size of his usable speaking vocabulary. The
addition of every new word is likely to indicate the
grasp of a new idea. Likewise, every new idea is
almost certain to require its individual terms for expression.
An enlarging vocabulary is the outward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>and visible sign of an inward and intellectual growth.
No man's vocabulary can equal the size of a dictionary,
the latest of which in English is estimated to contain
some 450,000 words. Life may be maintained upon a
surprisingly meager group of words, as travelers in
foreign lands can testify. Shakespeare's vocabulary
is said to have included as many as 15,000 words.
Figures for that of the average person vary considerably.</p>

<p><b>Increasing the Vocabulary.</b> The method of increasing
a vocabulary is a quite simple process. Its procedure
is a fascinating exercise. It covers four steps.
When a new word is encountered it should be noticed
with keen attention. If heard, its pronunciation will
be fixed upon the ear. If seen, its spelling should
be mastered at once. The next step is to consult a
dictionary for either spelling or pronunciation. Then
all its meanings should be examined. Still the word
is not yours until you have used it exactly. This you
should do at the first opportunity. If the opportunity
seems long in coming make it for yourself by
discussing with some one the topic with which it was
used or frankly discuss the word itself. How many
unfamiliar words have you heard or seen recently?
How many do you easily use now in your own remarks?
You might find it a good plan to take a linguistic
inventory every night. A little practice in this will
produce amazingly interesting and profitable results
in both use and understanding. A keenness for
words will be rapidly developed. Word-lists of all
kinds will take on entirely new meanings. A spontaneous
receptivity will develop into permanent retention
of words and phrases.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Tell of some new word you have added to your vocabulary
recently. Explain when you met it, how it happened
to impress you, what you learned of it.</p>

<p>2. In studying a foreign language how did you fix in your
mind the words which permanently stuck there?</p>

<p>3. Look over a page in a dictionary. Report to the class
on some interesting material you find.</p>

<p>4. Make a list of ten slang or technical expressions. Explain
them in exact, clear language.</p>

<p>5. Find and bring to class a short printed passage, which
because of the words, you cannot understand. Unusual
books, women's fashion magazines, technical journals, books
of rules for games, financial reports, contain good examples.</p>

<p>6. How much do you know about any of the following
words?</p>

<table class="table1" summary="Words">
<tr><td >chassis</td><td >fuselage</td><td >orthodox</td><td >sable</td></tr>
<tr><td >comptometer</td><td >germicide</td><td >plebescite</td><td >self-determination</td></tr>
<tr><td >covenant</td><td >layman</td><td >purloin</td><td >soviet</td></tr>
<tr><td >ethiopian</td><td >morale</td><td >querulous</td><td >vers libre</td></tr>
<tr><td >farce</td><td >nectar</td><td >renegade</td><td >zoom</td></tr>
</table>



<p>7. Comment on the words in the following extracts:</p>

<p>"Of enchanting crimson brocade is the slipover blouse
which follows the lines of the French cuirasse. Charmingly
simple, this blouse, quite devoid of trimming,
achieves smartness by concealing the waistline with five
graceful folds."</p>

<p>"The shift bid consists in bidding a suit, of which
you have little or nothing, with the ultimate object of
transferring later to another declaration, which is perfectly
sound. The idea is to keep your adversaries from lead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>ing
this suit up to your hand, which they will likely avoid
doing, thinking that you are strong in it."</p>

<p>"While sentiment is radically bearish on corn there is
so little pressure on the market other than from shorts that
a majority of traders are inclined to go slow in pressing
the selling side on breaks until the situation becomes more
clearly defined. The weekly forecast for cool weather is
regarded as favorable for husking and shelling, and while

<p><b>Thesaurus.</b> Besides frequently consulting a good
modern dictionary a student speaker should familiarize
himself with a <i>Thesaurus</i> of words and phrases. This
is a peculiarly useful compilation of expressions according
to their meaning relations. A dictionary lists
words, then gives their meanings. A Thesaurus arranges
meanings, then gives the words that express
those ideas. The value of such a book can be best
illustrated by explaining its use.</p>

<p>Suppose a speaker is going to attack some principle,
some act, some party. He knows that his main
theme will be denunciation of something. In the
index of a Thesaurus he looks under <i>denunciation</i>,
finding two numbers of paragraphs. Turning to
the first he has under his eye a group of words all
expressing shades of this idea. There are further
references to other related terms. Let us look at the
first group, taken from Roget's <i>Thesaurus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MALEDICTON, curse, imprecation, denunciation, execration,
anathema, ban, proscription, excommunication,
commination, fulmination.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Cursing, scolding, railing, Billingsgate language.</p>

<p><i>V</i>. To curse, accurse, imprecate, scold, rail, execrate.</p>

<p>To denounce, proscribe, excommunicate, fulminate.</p>

<p><i>Adj</i>. Cursing, &amp;c., cursed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>THREAT, menace, defiance, abuse, commination, intimidation.</p>

<p><i>V</i>. To threaten, menace, defy, fulminate; to intimidate.</p>

<p><i>Adj</i>. Threatening, menacing, minatory, abusive.</p></div>

<p>The second reference leads us farther. It presents
the expressions dealing with the methods and results
of <i>denunciation</i>, providing hundreds of words and
phrases to use in various ways. It does even more,
for in a parallel column it gives a list of opposites for
the words indicating <i>condemnation</i>. This more than
doubles its value. Finally having reached the word
<i>punishment</i> it lists its cognates until the idea <i>penalty</i>
is reached, where it balances that idea with <i>reward</i>
and its synonyms. A portion of this section follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>LAWSUIT, suit, action, cause, trial, litigation.</p>

<p>Denunciation, citation, arraignment, persecution,
indictment, impeachment, apprehension, arrest, committal,

<p>Pleadings, writ, summons, plea, bill, affidavit, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Verdict, sentence, judgment, finding, decree, arbitrament,

<p><i>V</i>. To go to law; to take the law of; to appeal to

<p>An observer will see at once just how far these lists
go and what must supplement them. They do not
define, they do not discriminate, they do not restrict.
They are miscellaneous collections. A person must
consult the dictionary or refer to some other authority
to prevent error or embarrassment in use. For instance,
under the entry <i>newspaper</i> occurs the attractive
word <i>ephemeris</i>. But one should be careful of how
and where he uses that word.</p>

<p>Another exercise which will aid in fixing both words
and meanings in the mind and also help in the power
of recalling them for instant use is to make some
kind of word-list according to some principle or scheme.
One plan might be to collect all the words dealing with
the idea of <i>book</i>. Another might be to take some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>obvious word root and then follow it and other roots
added to it through all its forms, meanings, and uses.
One might choose <i>tel</i> (distant) and <i>graph</i> (record)
and start with <i>telegraph</i>. <i>Telephone</i> will introduce
<i>phone</i>, <i>phonograph</i>; they will lead on to <i>dictaphone</i>,
<i>dictagraph</i>; the first half links with <i>dictation</i>; that
may lead as far away as <i>dictatorial</i>. In fact there is
no limit to the extent, the interest, and the value of
these various exercises. The single aim of all of
them should be, of course, the enlargement of the
speaking vocabulary. Mere curiosities, current slang,
far-fetched metaphors, passing foreign phrases, archaisms,
obsolete and obsolescent terms, too new coinages,
atrocities, should be avoided as a plague.</p>

<p>Consistent, persistent, insistent word-study is of
inestimable value to a speaker. And since all people
speak, it follows that it would benefit everybody.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Explain what is meant by each entry in the foregoing list.</p>

<p>2. List some verbal curiosities you have met recently.
Examples: "Mr. Have-it-your-own-way is the best husband."
"He shows a great deal of stick-to-it-iveness."</p>

<p>3. What should be the only condition for using foreign
expressions? Can you show how foreign words become
naturalized? Cite some foreign words used in speech.</p>

<p>4. Are archaic (old-fashioned), obsolete (discarded), and
obsolescent (rapidly disappearing) terms more common in
speech or books? Explain and illustrate.</p>

<p><b>Synonyms.</b> As has already been suggested, a
copious vocabulary must not be idle in a person's
equipment. He must be able to use it. He must be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>able to discriminate as to meaning. This power of
choosing the exact word results from a study of synonyms.
It is a fact that no two words mean <i>exactly</i>
the same thing. No matter how nearly alike the two
meanings may appear to be, closer consideration will
unfailingly show at least a slight difference of dignity,
if nothing more&mdash;as <i>red</i> and <i>crimson</i>, <i>pure</i> and <i>unspotted</i>.
Synonyms, then, are groups of words whose
meanings are almost the same. These are the words
which give so much trouble to learners of our language.
A foreigner is told that <i>stupid</i> means <i>dull</i>, yet he
is corrected if he says <i>a stupid knife</i>. Many who
learn English as a native tongue fail to comprehend
the many delicate shades of differences among
synonyms.</p>

<p>In this matter, also, a dictionary goes so far as to
list synonyms, and in some cases, actually adds a
discussion to define the various limits. For fuller,
more careful discrimination a good book of synonyms
should be consulted. Except for some general consideration
of words which everyone is certain to use
or misuse, it is better to consult a treatise on synonyms
when need arises than to study it consecutively. In
consultation the material will be fixed by instant use.
In study it may fade before being employed; it may
never be required.</p>

<p>The subjoined paragraphs show entries in two
different volumes upon synonyms:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Adjacent, adjoining, contiguous. Adjacent, in Latin,
<i>adjiciens</i>, participle of <i>adjicio</i>, is compounded of <i>ad</i> and
<i>jacio</i>, to lie near. <i>Adjoining</i>, as the word implies, signifies
being joined together. Contiguous, in French <i>contigu</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Latin <i>contiguus</i>, comes from <i>contingo</i>, or <i>con</i> and <i>tango</i>,
signifying to touch close.</p>

<p>What is <i>adjacent</i> may be separated altogether by the intervention
of some third object; what is <i>adjoining</i> must
touch in some part; and what is <i>contiguous</i> must be fitted
to touch entirely on one side. Lands are <i>adjacent</i> to a
house or town; fields are <i>adjoining</i> to each other; and
houses <i>contiguous</i> to each other.</p>
<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Crabbe: </span><i>English Synonyms</i></p>
</div>



<div class="blockquot"><p>Victory: Synonyms: achievement, advantage, conquest,
mastery, success, supremacy, triumph. <i>Victory</i> is the
state resulting from the overcoming of an opponent or opponents
in any contest, or from the overcoming of difficulties,
obstacles, evils, etc., considered as opponents or
enemies. In the latter sense any hard-won <i>achievement</i>,
<i>advantage,</i> or <i>success</i> may be termed a victory. In <i>conquest</i>
and <i>mastery</i> there is implied a permanence of state
that is not implied in <i>victory</i>. <i>Triumph</i>, originally denoting
the public rejoicing in honor of a <i>victory</i>, has come to signify
also a peculiarly exultant, complete, and glorious <i>victory</i>.
Compare <i>conquer</i>. Antonyms: defeat, destruction, disappointment,
disaster, failure, frustration, miscarriage, overthrow,
retreat, rout.</p>
<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Fernald: </span><i>English Synonyms, Antonyms and Prepositions</i></p>
</div>



<p><b>Antonyms.</b> Notice that this second paragraph adds
a new word-list&mdash;<i>antonyms</i>. To reinforce the understanding
of what a thing is, it is desirable to know
what it is not, or what its opposite is. This kind of
explanation or description is especially valuable to
a speaker. He can frequently impress an audience
more definitely by explaining the opposite of what he
wants them to apprehend. At times the term is not
the extreme opposite; it is merely the negative of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>other. Logically the other side of <i>white</i> is <i>not white</i>,
while the antonym is the extreme <i>black</i>. Trained
speakers use with great effect the principle underlying
such groups of words. When Burke argued
before the House of Commons for a plan to secure
harmony with the American colonies he described
the scheme he considered necessary by showing what
it should not be. "No partial, narrow, contracted,
pinched, occasional system will be at all suitable to
such an object." Describing the peace he hoped would
be secured he used this principle of opposites. "Not
peace through the medium of war; not peace to be
hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless
negotiations, not peace to arise out of universal
discord, fomented from principle in all parts of
the empire; not peace to depend on the juridical
determination of perplexing questions, or the precise
marking the shadowy boundaries of a complex government."</p>

<p>We are told by an investigator that one of the
reasons for a Frenchman's keen insight into the capabilities
of his language is the early training received
in schools covering differences among words. This
continual weighing of the meaning or the suitability
of an expression is bound to result in a delicate appreciation
of its value as a means of effective communication.
In all mental action the sense of contrast
is an especially lively one. In a later chapter
this principle, as applied to explanation and argument,
will be discussed. Just here, the point is that the
constant study of contrasts will sharpen the language
sense and rapidly enlarge the vocabulary.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Composition of the English Language.</b> Turning
now from the means of improving the speaker's language
equipment let us pass to some remarks upon his use
of words. The English language is the largest, the
most varied in the universe. Almost entirely free
from difficulties of inflection and conjugation, with a
simplified grammar, and a great freedom of construction,
it suffers from only two signal drawbacks&mdash;its
spelling and its pronunciation. While it has preserved
to a great degree its original Anglo-Saxon
grammar, it has enriched its vocabulary by borrowings
from everywhere. Its words have no distinctive
forms, so every foreign word can usually be naturalized
by a mere change of sound. No matter what their
origin, all belong to one family now; <i>gnu</i> is as much
English as <i>knew</i>, <i>japan</i> as <i>pogrom</i>, <i>f&ecirc;te</i> as <i>papoose</i>,
<i>batik</i> as <i>radii</i>, <i>ohm</i> as <i>marconigram</i>, <i>macadamized</i> as
<i>zoomed</i>. Most of the modern borrowings&mdash;as just
illustrated&mdash;were to serve for new things or ideas.
But there was one time when a great reduplication
of the vocabulary occurred. After the French conquered
England in 1066, English and Norman-French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>were spoken side by side. The resultant tongue,
composed of both, offered many doubles for the same
idea. In some instances the fashionable and aristocratic
French word marked a difference of meaning
as is clearly indicated by such pairs as <i>beef</i> and <i>ox</i>, <i>veal</i>
and <i>calf, mutton</i> and <i>sheep</i>, <i>pork</i> and <i>pig</i>. In
many other cases words of French and English origin
are separated by differences less distinct. Such are
<i>love</i> and <i>affection</i>, <i>worship</i> and <i>adoration</i>. A speaker
must take thought of such groups, and consciously
endeavor to use the more appropriate for his
purpose.</p>

<p><b>Anglo-Saxon and Romance.</b> It may help him
to remember that the Anglo-Saxon words are the more
homely, the closer to our everyday feelings and experiences,
the expression of our deepest ideas and
sentiments, the natural outspoken response to keen
emotion. On the other hand, the Romance words&mdash;as
they are called, whether from the French or directly
from the Latin&mdash;are likely to be longer; they belong
generally to the more complicated relationships of
society and government; they are more intellectual
in the sense that they represent the operations of
the brain rather than the impulses of the heart. They
deal with more highly trained wills, with more abstruse
problems; they reason, they argue, they consider;
they are philosophical, scientific, legal, historical.
Listen to a soldier relate his war experiences.
What will his vocabulary be? Listen to a diplomat
explaining the League of Nations. What will his
vocabulary be? Have you ever heard a speaker
who gave you the impression that all his words ended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>in <i>tion</i>? This was because his vocabulary was largely
Romance.</p>

<p>The inferences from the foregoing are perfectly
plain. Subject and audience will determine to a large
extent what kinds of words a speaker will choose.
The well-equipped speaker will be master of both
kinds; he will draw from either as occasion offers.
He will not insult one audience by talking below their
intelligence, nor will he bore another by speaking
over their heads.</p>

<p><b>General and Specific Terms.</b> Effective speaking
depends to a large extent upon the inclusion of specific
terms as contrasted with general terms. "Glittering
generalities" never make people listen. They mean
nothing because they say too much. Study the
following selections to see how the concrete phraseology
used makes the material more telling, how it
enforces the meaning. Pick out the best expressions
and explain why they are better than more general
terms. In the first, note how the last sentence drives
home the meaning of the first two. Listeners may
understand the first two, they remember the last.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All those fierce spirits whom you hallooed on to harass us

Did you think when you went on, session after session,
thwarting and reviling those whom you knew to be in the

you knew to be in the wrong, that the day of reckoning
would never come? It has come. There you sit, doing
penance for the disingenuousness of years.</p></div>

<p>Why was the style of the extract below especially
good for the evident purpose and audience? Why
did the author use names for the candidates?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When an American citizen is content with voting merely,
he consents to accept what is often a doubtful alternative.
His first duty is to help shape the alternative. This, which
was formerly less necessary, is now indispensable. In a
rural community such as this country was a hundred years-ago,
whoever was nominated for office was known to his
neighbors, and the consciousness of that knowledge was a
conservative influence in determining nominations. But
in the local elections of the great cities of today, elections
that control taxation and expenditure, the mass of the voters
vote in absolute ignorance of the candidates. The citizen
who supposes that he does all his duty when he votes, places
a premium upon political knavery. Thieves welcome him
to the polls and offer him a choice, which he has done nothing
to prevent, between Jeremy Diddler and Dick Turpin. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>party cries for which he is responsible are: "Turpin and
Honesty," "Diddler and Reform." And within a few years,
as a result of this indifference to the details of public duty,
the most powerful politicians in the Empire State of the
Union was Jonathan Wild, the Great, the captain of a band
of plunderers.</p>

<p><b>Appropriate Diction.</b> The final test of any diction
is its appropriateness. The man who talks of dignified
things as he would of a baseball game&mdash;unless
he is doing it deliberately for humor, caricature, or
burlesque&mdash;is ruining his own cause. The man
who discusses trifles in the style of philosophy makes
himself an egregious bore. As Shakespeare said,
"Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;
with this special observance, that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature."</p>

<p>Beware of the flowery expression; avoid metaphorical
speech; flee from the lure of the overwrought
style. In the first place it is so old-fashioned that
audiences suspect it at once. It fails to move them.
It may plunge its user into ridiculous failure. In
the excitement of spontaneous composition a man
sometimes takes risks. He may&mdash;as Pitt is reported
to have said he did&mdash;throw himself into a sentence
and trust to God Almighty to get him out. But a
beginner had better walk before he tries to soar. If
he speaks surely rather than amazingly his results
will be better. The temptation to leave the ground
is ever present in speaking.</p>

<p>A Parliamentary debater describing the Church
of England wound up in a flowery conclusion thus:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>"I see the Church of England rising in the land, with
one foot firmly planted in the soil, the other stretched
toward Heaven!"</p>

<p>An American orator discussing the character of
Washington discharged the following.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The higher we rise in the scale of being&mdash;material, intellectual,
and moral&mdash;the more certainly we quit the region
of the brilliant eccentricities and dazzling contrasts which
belong to a vulgar greatness. Order and proportion characterize
the primordial constitution of the terrestrial system;
ineffable harmony rules the heavens. All the great eternal
forces act in solemn silence. The brawling torrent that
dries up in summer deafens you with its roaring whirlpools
in March; while the vast earth on which we dwell, with all
its oceans and all its continents and its thousand millions of
inhabitants, revolves unheard upon its soft axle at the rate
of a thousand miles an hour, and rushes noiselessly on its
orbit a million and a half miles a day. Two storm-clouds
encamped upon opposite hills on a sultry summer's evening,
at the expense of no more electricity, according to Mr.
Faraday, than is evolved in the decomposition of a single
drop of water, will shake the surrounding atmosphere with
their thunders, which, loudly as they rattle on the spot,
will yet not be heard at the distance of twenty miles; while
those tremendous and unutterable forces which ever issue
from the throne of God, and drag the chariot wheels of
Uranus and Neptune along the uttermost path-ways of
the solar system, pervade the illimitable universe in silence.</p></div>

<p>Of course, today, nobody talks like that. At least
no one should.</p>

<p><b>Trite Expressions.</b> Less easily guarded against is
the delivery of trite expressions. These are phrases
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>and clauses which at first were so eloquent that once
heard they stuck in people's minds, who then in an
endeavor themselves to be emphatic inserted continually
into their speeches these overworked, done-to-death
expressions, which now having been used
too frequently have no real meaning. One of
the most frequently abused is "of the people, by
the people, for the people." Others are words and
phrases made popular by the war. Many are no
more than jargon&mdash;meaningless counterfeits instead
of the legal tender of real speech. It is amazing
to notice how persistently some of them recur in the
remarks of apparently well-trained men who should
know better than to insert them. The following
were used by a prominent United States political
leader in a single speech. He could; easily have
replaced them by living material or dispensed with
them entirely.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Jot or tittle; the plain unvarnished truth; God forbid;
the jackal press; that memorable occasion; tooth and nail;
the God of our fathers; the awful horrors of Valley Forge;
the blood-stained heights of Yorktown; tell it not in Gath;
proclaim it not in the streets of Askalon; peace with honor;
the Arabian Nights; Munchausen; the fathers; our globe-encircling

Barbary Coast; Democratic gospel pure and undefiled;
Janus-faced double; Good Lord, good devil; all things to

<div class="blockquot"><p>And now, if they would listen&mdash;as I suppose they will
not&mdash;I would address a few words to the Southern people.</p>

<p>I would say to them: You consider yourselves a reasonable

qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other
people. Still, when you speak of us Republicans, you do
so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no
better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or
murderers, but nothing like it to "Black Republicans." In
all your contentions with one another, each of you deems an
unconditional condemnation of "Black Republicanism"
as the first thing to be attended to. Indeed, such condemnation
of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite&mdash;license,
so to speak&mdash;among you to be admitted or permitted
to speak at all. Now can you or not be prevailed
upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to
us, or even to yourselves? Bring forward your charges and
specifications, and then be patient long enough to hear us
deny or justify.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Sentences.</b> What kinds of sentences shall
a speaker construct as he speaks? That there is a
difference between those a person composes when he
writes and those the same person is likely to evolve
when he speaks is realized by everyone. We hear
that a speaker is "booky," or conversational, that
he is stilted or lively, that he is too formal, that his
discourse is dull and flat. To a great degree these
criticisms are based upon the sentence structure.</p>

<p><b>The Simple Sentence.</b> The simple sentence contains
only one subject and one predicate. The complex
sentence contains one independent clause and at
least one subordinate clause. The compound sentence
contains two or more independent clauses. It
would be good advice to urge the employment of the
simple sentence were it not for the fact that a long
succession of sentences constructed exactly alike,
making the same impression of form and sound and
length, is likely to produce a deadly monotony of
emphasis and pause, an impression of immaturity on
the part of the speaker and of lack of skill in molding
his phrases. Yet, in the main, the simple sentence
is a valuable kind to know how to deliver. Containing
but a single thought it is likely to make a
definite impression upon a listener. It offers him not
too much to grasp. It leads him a single step along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>the way. It speaks clearly, concisely. Its advantages
follow from its qualities. At the beginning of
addresses it is especially efficient in leading the audience
at the same rate&mdash;slowly, it should be&mdash;as
the speaker. In intricate explanation, in close reasoning,
in matters of paramount importance, it should
be employed.</p>

<p>Management of the short, simple sentence in written
prose is difficult. In spoken discourse, as well, it is
so easy to fall into the First Primer style that while
the advantages of the use of the simple sentence are
great, the ability to produce good sentences in succession
must be developed.</p>

<p><b>The Complex Sentence.</b> The complex sentence
offers a good form for introducing pertinent, minor
details, which are necessary, yet which do not merit
inclusion in the general level of the speech. Aided
by proper pitch and inflection of the voice, they can
be skilfully subordinated to main ideas, yet introduced
so adroitly that they at times relieve attention,
at others briefly explain, at others keep adding up
in a series the effect of which is a large total. Frequently
such sentences indicate clearly the progress
of the discussion. A topic introduced in a subordinate
clause may later be raised to more importance without
abruptness, for hearers are already familiar with it. A
topic already treated may be recalled by citation in
a later clause. So various parts of a speech may be
closely knit together to present a coherent, progressive,
unified whole.</p>

<p>In easily grasped general, descriptive, narrative,
explanatory material, complex sentences will allow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>the covering of a wide field, or a long time, in short
order by condensing facts into the few words of
subordinate clauses.</p>

<p><b>The Compound Sentence.</b> Somewhat like the use
of complex sentences for general material is the use
of compound ones for informal topics, familiar discourse,
easy address, lighter material. Valuable, too,
is this form for the speaker who knows accurately the
meaning of conjunctions, who can avoid the stringing
together of what should be simple sentences by a
dozen senseless <i>ands</i>. A good rule for the beginner
is to allow no <i>ands</i> in his speeches except those so
imbedded in phrases&mdash;husband and wife, now and
then, principal and interest&mdash;that he cannot avoid
them. Let him never speak such sentences as, "I
came to this meeting and discovered only when I
got here that I was scheduled to speak." Let him
be careful of beginning sentence's with <i>and</i> after he has
made a pause.</p>

<p><b>The Exclamatory Sentence.</b> Many speakers yield
to the temptation to strive for effect by delivering
exclamatory sentences&mdash;sometimes only clauses and
phrases so enunciated. The disposition to do this
is born of the desire to be emphatic. Strong feeling
makes one burst out in ejaculation. Used sparingly
this form may be extremely effective. Used too
frequently it reduces a speech to a mere series of ejaculations
of little more value than a succession of
grunts, groans, and sobs. Exclamatory sentences
seldom convey much meaning. They indicate emotion.
But a speech, to be worth listening to, must convey
ideas.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Interrogative Sentence.</b> A second sentence
which may be classed with the preceding is the interrogative.
There is a disposition on the part of
speakers to ask direct questions of the audience.
Frequently the rhetorical question&mdash;which is one
asked because the answer is the quite apparent fact
the speaker wants to impress upon his hearers&mdash;is
an effective method of making a seemingly personal
appeal to sluggish intellects or lazy wills. The interrogative
form has the same disadvantage as the
exclamatory. Except when its answer is perfectly
plain it transfers no meaning. It would be easily
possible for a speaker with no ideas at all, no knowledge
of a topic, to engage time and attention by merely
constructing a series of questions. At the conclusion
the audience would wonder why in the world he spoke,
for he had so little to say.</p>

<p><b>Long and Short Sentences.</b> So far as long and
short sentences are concerned some general rules
have already been hinted at in dealing with other
kinds. The advantages of the short sentence are
mainly those of clearness, directness, emphasis. Its
dangers are monotony, bareness, over-compactness.
The advantages of the long&mdash;that is, quite long&mdash;sentence,
are rather difficult to comprehend. A
wordy sentence is likely to defeat its own purpose.
Instead of guiding it will lose its hearer. Somewhat
long sentences&mdash;as already said&mdash;will serve in general
discussions, in rapidly moving descriptive and
narrative passages, in rather simple explanation and
argument. No one can state at just what number of
words a short sentence becomes medium, and when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>the division of medium becomes long. Yet there
must be some limits. A sentence in <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>
includes nearly one thousand words in both French
original and English translation. John Milton produced
some extraordinarily long sentences. But these
are in written discourse. Some modern speakers have
come dangerously near the limit. In one printed
speech one sentence has four hundred ten words in
it; a later one goes to five hundred forty. This
second would fill about half a column of the usual
newspaper. Surely these are much too long. A
speaker can frequently make a long sentence acceptable
by breaking it up into shorter elements by sensible
pauses. Yet the general direction must surely be:
avoid sentences which are too long.</p>

<p><b>Variety.</b> The paramount rule of sentence structure
in speech-making is certainly: secure variety. Long,
medium, short; declarative, exclamatory, interrogative;
simple, loose, periodic; use them all as material
permits and economy of time and attention prescribes.
With the marvelous variety possible in English sentence
structure, no person with ideas and language
at command need be a monotonous speaker.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Criticize this selection for its diction and sentence

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The books in the library, the portraits, the table at

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>animals and implements of husbandry, the trees planted
by him in lines, in copses, in orchards by thousands, the
seat under the noble elm on which he used to sit to feel
the southwest wind at evening, or hear the breathings of
the sea, or the not less audible music of the starry heavens,
all seemed at first unchanged. The sun of a bright day
from which, however, something of the fervors of midsummer
were wanting, fell temperately on them all, filled
the air on all sides with the utterances of life, and gleamed
on the long line of ocean. Some of those whom on earth
he loved best, still were there. The great mind still
seemed to preside; the great presence to be with you;
you might expect to hear again the rich and playful tones
of the voice of the old hospitality. Yet a moment more,
and all the scene took on the aspect of one great monument,
inscribed with his name, and sacred to his memory.
And such it shall be in all the future of America! The
sensation of desolateness, and loneliness, and darkness,
with which you see it now, will pass away; the sharp
grief of love and friendship will become soothed; men
will repair thither as they are wont to commemorate the
great days of history; the same glance shall take in, and
same emotions shall greet and bless, the Harbor of the
Pilgrims and the Tomb of Webster."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Look at the manner in which the people of New
England have of late carried on the whale fishery. Whilst
we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice,
and behold them penetrating into the deepest frozen
recess of Hudson's Bay and Davis' Straits, whilst we are
looking for them beneath the arctic circle, we hear that
they have pierced into the opposite region of polar cold,
that they are at the antipodes, and engaged under the
frozen Serpent of the South. Falkland Islands, which
seemed too remote and romantic an object for the grasp
of national ambition, is but a stage and resting-place in
the progress of their victorious industry. Nor is the
equinoctial heat more discouraging to them than the
accumulated winter of both the poles. We know that
whilst some of them draw the line and strike the harpoon
on the coast of Africa, others run the longitude and
pursue their gigantic game along the coast of Brazil.
No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries; no climate
that is not witness to their toil. Neither the perseverance
of Holland, nor the activity of France, nor the dexterous
and firm sagacity of English enterprise ever carried this
most perilous mode of hardy industry to the extent to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>which it has been pushed by, this recent people; a people
who are still, as it were, but in the gristle, and not yet

below them descends to those who are the very lowest of
all; and a Protestant cobbler, debased by his poverty,
but exalted by his share of the ruling church, feels a pride
in knowing it is by his generosity alone that the peer,
whose footman's instep he measures, is able to keep his
chaplain from a gaol. This disposition is the true source

fear nothing so much as bolting and scratching. <i>In hoc

scratches the weeds out of his field. If we would have
good men upon the ticket, we must scratch bad men off.
If the scratching breaks down the party, let it break:

<h3>BEGINNING THE SPEECH</h3>


<p><b>Speech-making a Formal Matter.</b> Every speech
is more or less a formal affair. The speaker standing
is separated from the other persons present by
his prominence. He is removed from them by standing
while they sit, by being further away from them
than in ordinary conversation. The greater the
distance between him and his listeners the more
formal the proceeding becomes. When a person
speaks "from the floor" as it is called, that is, by
simply rising at his seat and speaking, there is a marked
difference in the manner of his delivery and also in
the effect upon the audience. In many gatherings,
speeches and discussions "from the floor" are not
allowed at all, in others this practice is the regular
method of conducting business. Even in the schoolroom
when the student speaks from his place he feels
less responsibility than when he stands at the front
of the room before his classmates. As all formal
exercises have their regular rules of procedure it will
be well to list the more usual formulas for beginnings
of speeches.</p>

<p><b>The Salutation.</b> In all cases where speeches are
made there is some person who presides. This person
may be the Vice-President of the United States presiding
over the Senate, the Speaker of the House of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Representatives, the Chief Justice of the United
States Supreme Court, the president of a city board
of aldermen, the judge of a court, the president of a
corporation, of a lodge, of a church society, of a club,
the pastor of a church, the chancellor or provost or
dean of a college, the principal of a school, the chairman
of a committee, the toastmaster of a banquet, the
teacher of a class. The first remark of a speaker
must always be the recognition of this presiding
officer.</p>

<p>Then there are frequently present other persons
who are distinct from the ordinary members of the
audience, to whom some courtesy should be shown in
this salutation. Their right to recognition depends
upon their rank, their importance at the time, some
special peculiar reason for separating them from the
rest of the audience. The speaker will have to decide
for himself in most cases as to how far he will classify
his hearers. In some instances there is no difficulty.
Debaters must recognize the presiding officer, the
judges if they be distinct from the regular audience,
the members of the audience itself. Lawyers in
court must recognize only the judge and the "gentlemen
of the jury." In a debate on the first draft for
the League of Nations presided over by the Governor
of Massachusetts, Senator Lodge's salutation was
"Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, My Fellow
Americans." The last was added unquestionably because
patriotic feeling was so strong at the time that
reference to our nationality was a decidedly fitting
compliment, and also perhaps, because the speaker
realized that his audience might be slightly prejudiced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>against the view he was going to advance in criticizing
the League Covenant. At times a formal salutation
becomes quite long to include all to whom recognition
is due. At a university commencement a speaker
might begin: "Mr. Chancellor, Members of the
Board of Trustees, Gentlemen of the Faculty, Candidates
for Degrees, Ladies and Gentlemen."</p>

<p>Other salutations are Your Honor, Mr. President,
Mr. Speaker, Madame President, Madame Chairman,
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Stevenson, Sir, Mr. Toastmaster,
Mr. Moderator, Honorable Judges, Ladies, Gentlemen,
Fellow Citizens, Classmates, Fellow Workers,
Gentlemen of the Senate, Gentlemen of the Congress,
Plenipotentiaries of the German Empire, My Lord
Mayor and Citizens of London; Mr. Mayor, Mr.
Secretary, Admiral Fletcher and Gentlemen of the
Fleet; Mr. Grand Master, Governor McMillan, Mr.
Mayor, My Brothers, Men and Women of Tennessee.</p>

<p>The most important thing about the salutation is
that it should never be omitted. To begin to speak
without having first recognized some presiding officer
and the audience stamps one immediately as thoughtless,
unpractised, or worse still&mdash;discourteous.</p>

<p>Having observed the propriety of the salutation
the speaker should make a short pause before he proceeds
to the introduction of his speech proper.</p>

<p><b>Length of the Introduction.</b> There was a time when
long elaborate introductions were the rule, and textbooks
explained in detail how to develop them. The
main assumption seems to have been that the farther
away from his topic the speaker began, the longer
and more indirect the route by which he approached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>it, the more sudden and surprising the start with
which it was disclosed to the audience, the better the
speech. Such views are no longer held. One of the
criticisms of the speeches of the English statesman,
Burke, is that instead of coming at once to the important
matter under consideration&mdash;and all his speeches
were upon paramount issues&mdash;he displayed his rhetorical
skill and literary ability before men impatient
to finish discussion and provide for action by casting
their votes. If a student will read the beginning of
Burke's famous <i>Speech on Conciliation</i> he will readily
understand the force of this remark, for instead of
bringing forward the all-important topic of arranging
for colonial adjustment Burke uses hundreds of words
upon the "flight of a bill for ever," his own pretended
superstitiousness and belief in omens. So strong is
the recognition of the opposite practice today that
it is at times asserted that speeches should dispense
with introductions longer than a single sentence.</p>

<p><b>Purpose of the Introduction.</b> So far as the material
of the speech is concerned the introduction
has but one purpose&mdash;to bring the topic of the succeeding
remarks clearly and arrestingly before the
audience. It should be clearly done, so that there
shall be no misunderstanding from the beginning.
It should be arrestingly done, so that the attention
shall be aroused and held from this announcement
even until the end. A man should not declare that
he is going to explain the manufacture of paper-cutters,
and then later proceed to describe the making
of those frames into which rolls of wrapping paper
are fitted underneath a long cutting blade, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>to most people the expression "paper-cutters" means
dull-edged, ornamental knives for desks and library
tables. His introduction would not be clear. On
the other hand if a minister were to state plainly that
he was going to speak on the truth that "it is more
blessed to give than to receive" his congregation
might turn its attention to its own affairs at once
because the topic promises no novelty. But if he
declares that he is going to make a defense of selfishness
he would surely startle his hearers into attention,
so that he could go on to describe the personal satisfaction
and peace of mind which comes to the doers
of good deeds. A speaker could arrest attention by
stating that he intended to prove the immorality of
the principle that "honesty is the best policy," if
he proceeded to plead for that virtue not as a repaying
<i>policy</i> but as an innate guiding principle of right, no
matter what the consequences. In humorous, half-jesting,
ironical material, of course, clearness may be
justifiably sacrificed to preserving interest. The introduction
may state the exact opposite of the real
topic.</p>

<p>When nothing else except the material of the introduction
need be considered, it should be short. Even
in momentous matters this is true. Notice the brevity
of the subjoined introduction of a speech upon a deeply
moving subject.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gentlemen of the Congress:</p>

<p>The Imperial German Government on the 31st day of
January announced to this Government and to the Governments
of the other neutral nations that on and after the 1st
day of February, the present month, it would adopt a policy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>with regard to the use of submarines against all shipping
seeking to pass through certain designated areas of the high
seas, to which it is clearly my duty to call your attention.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Woodrow Wilson</span>, 1917</p>
</div>

<p>The following, though much longer, aims to do the
same thing&mdash;to announce the topic of the speech
clearly. Notice that in order to emphasize this
endeavor to secure clearness the speaker declares
that he has repeatedly tried to state his position in
plain English. He then makes clear that he is not
opposed to <i>a</i> League of Nations; he is merely opposed
to the terms already submitted for the one about to
be formed. This position he makes quite clear in
the last sentence here quoted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, My Fellow
Americans:</p>

<p>I am largely indebted to President Lowell for this opportunity
to address this great audience. He and I are friends
of many years, both Republicans. He is the president of
our great university, one of the most important and influential
places in the United States. He is also an eminent
student and historian of politics and government. He and
I may differ as to methods in this great question now before
the people, but I am sure that in regard to the security of
the peace of the world and the welfare of the United States
we do not differ in purposes.</p>

<p>I am going to say a single word, if you will permit me, as
to my own position. I have tried to state it over and over
again. I thought I had stated it in plain English. But
there are those who find in misrepresentation a convenient
weapon for controversy, and there are others, most excellent
people, who perhaps have not seen what I have said and
who possibly have misunderstood me. It has been said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>that I am against any League of Nations. I am not; far
from it. I am anxious to have the nations, the free nations
of the world, united in a league, as we call it, a society, as
the French call it, but united, to do all that can be done to
secure the future peace of the world and to bring about a
general disarmament.</p>

<p>The Introduction and the Audience. When we
turn from the material of the introduction or the
speech we naturally consider the audience. Just as
the salutations already listed in this chapter indicate
how careful speakers are in adapting their very first
words to the special demands of recognition for a
single audience, so a study of introductions to speeches
which have been delivered will support the same
principle. A speech is made to affect a single audience,
therefore it must be fitted as closely as possible to
that audience in order to be effective. A city official
invited to a neighborhood gathering to instruct citizens
in the method of securing a children's playground
in that district is not only wasting time but insulting
the brains and dispositions of his listeners if he drawls
off a long introduction showing the value of public
playgrounds in a crowded city. His presence before
that group of people proves that they accept all he
can tell them on that topic. He is guilty of making
a bad introduction which seriously impairs the value
of anything he may say later concerning how this
part of the city can induce the municipal government
to set aside enough money to provide the open space
and the apparatus. Yet this speech was made in a
large American city by an expert on playgrounds.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>People remembered more vividly his wrong kind of
opening remarks than they did his advice concerning
a method of procedure.</p>

<p><b>Effect of the Introduction upon the Audience.</b> Many
centuries ago a famous and successful Roman orator
stipulated the purpose of an introduction with respect
to the audience. Cicero stated that an introduction
should render its hearers "<i>benevolos, attentos, dociles</i>";
that is, kindly disposed towards the speaker himself,
attentive to his remarks, and willing to be instructed
by his explanations or arguments. Not everyone
has a pleasing personality but he can strive to acquire
one. He can, perhaps, not add many attributes to
offset those nature has given him, but he can always
reduce, eradicate, or change those which interfere
with his reception by others. Education and training
will work wonders for people who are not blessed
with that elusive quality, charm, or that winner of
consideration, impressiveness. Self-examination, self-restraint,
self-development, are prime elements in
such a process. Great men have not been beyond
criticism for such qualities. Great men have recognized
their value and striven to rid themselves of
hindrances and replace them by helps.</p>

<p>Every reader is familiar with Benjamin Franklin's
account of his own method as related in his <i>Autobiography</i>,
yet it will bear quotation here to illustrate
this point:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While I was intent on improving my language, I met with
an English Grammar (I think it was Greenwood's), at the
end of which there were two little sketches of the arts of
rhetoric and logic, the latter "finishing with a specimen of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>a dispute in the Socratic method; and soon after I procured
Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates, wherein there
are many instances of the same method. I was charmed
with it, adopted it, dropt my abrupt contradiction and
positive argumentation, and put on the humble inquirer
and doubter.... I found this method safest for myself
and very embarrassing to those against whom I used it;
therefore I took a delight in it, practised it continually,
and grew very artful and expert in drawing people, even of
superior knowledge, into concessions, the consequences of
which they did not foresee, entangling them in difficulties
out of which they could not extricate themselves, and so
obtaining victories that neither myself nor my cause always
deserved. I continued this method some few years, but
gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself
in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I
advanced anything that may possibly be disputed, the words
<i>Certainly, Undoubtedly</i>, or any others that give the air of
positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or
apprehend a thing to be so and so; it appears to me, or <i>I
should think it so or so</i>, for such and such reasons; or <i>I
imagine it to be so</i>; or <i>it is so if I am not mistaken</i>. This
habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I
have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade
men into measures that I have been from time to time engaged
in promoting; and as the chief ends of conversation
are to <i>inform</i> or to be <i>informed</i>, to <i>please</i> or to <i>persuade</i>, I
wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their
power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that
seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to
defeat everyone of those purposes for which speech was
given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure.
For if you would inform, a positive and dogmatical manner
in advancing your sentiments may provoke contradiction
and prevent a candid attention. If you wish information
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>and improvement from the knowledge of others, and yet
at the same time express yourself as firmly fixed in your
present opinions, modest, sensible men who do not love
disputation will probably leave you undisturbed in the
possession of your error. And by such a manner you can
seldom hope to recommend yourself in <i>pleasing</i> your hearers,
or to persuade those whose concurrence you desire. Pope
says, judiciously:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Men should be taught as if you taught them not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And things unknown propos'd as things forgot;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>farther recommending to us</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To speak, tho' sure, with seeming diffidence."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of course an audience must be induced to listen.
The obligation is always with the speaker. He is
appealing for consideration, he wants to affect the
hearers, therefore he must have at his command all
the resources of securing their respectful attention.
He must be able to employ all the legitimate means
of winning their attention. A good speaker will not
stoop to use any tricks or devices that are not legitimate.
A trick, even when it is successful, is still
nothing but a trick, and though it secure the temporary
attention of the lower orders of intellect it can
never hold the better minds of an audience. Surprises,
false alarms, spectacular appeals, may find their defenders.
One widely reputed United States lawyer
in speaking before audiences of young people used
to advance theatrically to the edge of the stage, and,
then, pointing an accusing finger at one part of the
audience, declare in loud ringing tones, "You're a
sneak!" It is questionable whether any attempt at
arousing interest could justify such a brusque ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>proach.
Only in broadly comic or genuinely humorous
addresses can it be said that the end justifies the means.</p>

<p>When the audience has been induced to listen, the
rest should be easy for the good speaker. Then comes
into action his skill at explanation, his ability to reason
and convince, to persuade and sway, which is the
speaker's peculiar art. If they will listen to him,
he should be able to instruct them. The introduction
must, so far as this last is concerned, clear the way
for the remainder of the speech. The methods by
which such instruction, reasoning, and persuasion
are effected best will be treated later in this book.</p>

<p>Having covered the preceding explanation of the
aims and forms of introductions, let us look at a few
which have been delivered by regularly practising
speech-makers before groups of men whose interest,
concern, and business it was to listen. All men who
speak frequently are extremely uneven in their quality
and  just as irregular in their success. One of the
best instances of this unevenness and irregularity was
Edmund Burke, whose career and practice are bound
to afford food for thought and discussion to every
student of the power and value of the spoken word.
Some of Burke's speeches are models for imitation
and study, others are warnings for avoidance. At
one time when he felt personally disturbed by the
actions of the House of Commons, because he as a
member of the minority could not affect the voting,
he began a speech exactly as no man should under
any circumstances. No man in a deliberative assembly
can be excused for losing control of himself.
Yet Burke opened his remarks with these plain words.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mr. Speaker! I rise under some embarrassment occasioned
by a feeling of delicacy toward one-half of the
House, and of sovereign contempt for the other half."</p>

<p>This is childish, of course. A man may not infrequently
be forced by circumstances to speak before
an audience whose sentiments, opinions, prejudices,
all place them in a position antagonistic to his own.
How shall he make them well-disposed, attentive,
willing to be instructed? The situation is not likely
to surround a beginning speaker, but men in affairs,
in business, in courts, must be prepared for such circumstances.
One of the most striking instances of
a man who attempted to speak before an antagonistic
group and yet by sheer power of his art and language
ended by winning them to his own party is in Shakespeare's
<i>Julius Caesar</i> when Mark Antony speaks
over his dead friend's body. Brutus allows it, but
insists on speaking to the people first that he may
explain why he and his fellow conspirators assassinated
the great leader. It was a mistake to allow a person
from the opposite party to have the last word before
the populace, but that is not the point just here.
Brutus is able to explain why a group of noble Romans
felt that for the safety of the state and its inhabitants,
they had to kill the rising favorite who would soon
as King rule them all. When he ceases speaking, the
citizens approve the killing. Mark Antony perceives
that, so at the beginning of his speech he seems
to agree with the people. Caesar was his friend, yet
Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable
man. Thus the skilful orator makes the populace
well-disposed towards him, then attentive.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>Having secured those things he proceeds slowly and
unobtrusively to instruct them. It takes only a
few lines until he has made them believe all he wants
them to; before the end of his oration he has them
crying out upon the murderers of their beloved Caesar,
for whose lives they now thirst. Yet only ten minutes
earlier they were loudly acclaiming them as deliverers
of their country. The entire scene should be analyzed
carefully by the student. It is the second scene of
the third act of the play.</p>

<p>In actual life a man would hardly have to go so far
as seemingly to agree with such opposite sentiments
as expressed in this situation from a stage tragedy.
It is general knowledge that during the early years of
the American Civil War England sympathized with
the southern states, mainly because the effective
blockade maintained by the North prevented raw
cotton from reaching the British mills. Henry Ward
Beecher attempted to present the union cause to the
English in a series of addresses throughout the country.
When he appeared upon the platform in Liverpool
the audience broke out into a riot of noise which effectively
drowned all his words for minutes. The
speaker waited until he could get in a phrase. Finally
he was allowed to deliver a few sentences. By his
patience, his appeal to their English sense of fair play,
and to a large degree by his tolerant sense of humor,
he won their attention. His material, his power as
a speaker did all the rest.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is a matter of very little consequence to me, personally,
whether I speak here tonight or not. [<i>Laughter and cheers.</i>]
But one thing is very certain, if you do permit me to speak
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>here tonight, you will hear very plain talking. [<i>Applause
and hisses</i>.] You will not find me to be a man that dared to
speak about Great Britain three thousand miles off, and then
is afraid to speak to Great Britain when he stands on her
shores. [<i>Immense applause and hisses</i>.] And if I do not
mistake the tone and temper of Englishmen they had rather
have a man who opposes them in a manly way [<i>applause
from all parts of the hall</i>] than a sneak that agrees with them
in an unmanly way. [<i>Applause and "Bravo!"</i>] Now, if
I can carry you with me by sound convictions, I shall be immensely
glad [<i>applause</i>]; but if I cannot carry you with
me by facts and sound arguments, I do not wish you to go
with me at all; and all that I ask is simply fair play. [<i>Applause,
and a voice: "You shall have it too."</i>.]</p>

<p>Those of you who are kind enough to wish to favor my
speaking&mdash;and you will observe that my voice is slightly
husky, from having spoken almost every night in succession
for some time past&mdash;those who wish to hear me will do me
the kindness simply to sit still and to keep still; and I and
my friends the Secessionists will make the noise. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p>The beginning of one of Daniel Webster's famous
speeches was a triumph of the deliverer's recognition
of the mood of an audience. In the Senate in 1830
feeling had been running high over a resolution concerning
public lands. Innocent enough in its appearance,
this resolution really covered an attempt
at the extension of the slavery territory. Both North
and South watched the progress of the debate upon
this topic with almost held breath. Hayne of South
Carolina had spoken upon it during two days when
Webster rose to reply to him. The Senate galleries
were packed, the members themselves were stirred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>up to the highest pitch of keen intensity. Nearly
the entire effect of Webster's statement and argument
for the North depended upon the effect he could make
upon the Senators at the very opening of his speech.</p>

<p>Webster began in a low voice, with a calm manner,
to speak very slowly. In a second he had soothed
the emotional tension, set all the hearers quite at
ease, and by the time the Secretary had read the resolution
asked by Webster, he had them in complete
control. His task was to make them attentive, but
more especially, ready to be instructed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. President: When the mariner has been tossed for
many days in thick weather and on an unknown sea, he
naturally avails himself of the first pause in the storm, the
earliest glance of the sun, to take his latitude and ascertain

Let us imitate this prudence; and, before we float farther on
the waves of this debate, refer to the point from which we
departed, that we may, at least, be able to conjecture where
we now are. I ask for the reading of the resolution before
the Senate.</p>

<p><b>Linking the Introduction to Preceding Speeches.</b>
So many speeches are replies to preceding addresses
that many introductions adapt themselves to their
audiences by touching upon such utterances. In debates,
in pleas in court, in deliberative assemblies,
this is more usually the circumstance than not. The
following illustrates how courteously this may be done,
even when it serves merely to make all the clearer
the present speaker's position. In moments of tensest
feeling great speakers skilfully move from any one
position or attitude to another as Patrick Henry did.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>While you are regarding these paragraphs as an
example of introduction do not overlook their vocabulary
and sentences.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. President: No man thinks more highly than I do of
the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen
who have just addressed the house. But different men
often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore,
I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen,
if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very
opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely,
and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The
question before the house is one of awful moment to the
country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less
than a question of freedom or slavery. And in proportion
to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of
the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to
arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which
we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my
opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I
should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my
country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty
of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly things.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the
illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a
painful truth, and listen to the song of that Siren till she
transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged
in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we
disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes see
not, and having ears hear not, the things which so nearly
concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever
anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole
truth; to know the worst and to provide for it.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Patrick Henry</span> in the Virginia Convention, 1775</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Difficulties of Introductions.</b> People who are scheduled
to make speeches are heard to declare that they
know exactly what they want to say but they do not
know how to begin. Another way they have of expressing
this is that they do not know how to bring
their material before their hearers. Undoubtedly
the most difficult parts of speeches are the beginnings
and conclusions. In Chapter II one of the methods
of preparing for delivery recognized this difference
by recording that one way is to memorize the beginning
and ending, the opening and closing sentences.
Practised speakers are more likely not to
fix too rigidly in their minds any set way for starting
to speak. They realize that a too carefully prepared
opening will smack of the study. The conditions
under which the speech is actually delivered
may differ so widely from the anticipated surroundings
that a speaker should be able to readjust his
ideas instantly, seize upon any detail of feeling, remark,
action, which will help him into closer communication
with his audience. Many practised speakers, therefore,
have at their wits' ends a dozen different manners,
so that their appearance may fit in best with
the circumstances, and their remarks have that air
of easy spontaneity which the best speaking should
have. Thus, sometimes, the exactly opposite advice
of the method described above and in Chapter II is
given. A speaker will prepare carefully his speech
proper, but leave to circumstances the suggestion
of the beginning he will use. This does not mean
that he will not be prepared&mdash;it means that he will
be all the more richly furnished with expedients. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>speaker should carefully think over all the possibilities
under which his speech will be brought forward, then
prepare the best introduction to suit each set.</p>

<p><b>Spirit of the Introduction.</b> The combination of
circumstances and material will determine what we
shall call the spirit of the introduction. In what
spirit is the introduction treated? There are as
many different treatments as there are human feelings
and sentiments. The spirit may be serious, informative,
dignified, scoffing, argumentative, conversational,
startling, humorous, ironic. The student should
lengthen this list by adding as many other adjectives
as he can.</p>

<p>The serious treatment is always effective when it
is suitable. There is a conviction of earnestness and
sincerity about the speech of a man who takes his
subject seriously. Without arousing opposition by
too great a claim of importance for his topic he does
impress its significance upon listeners. This seriousness
must be justified by the occasion. It must not
be an attempt to bolster up weakness of ideas or commonplaceness
of expression. It must be straightforward,
manly, womanly. Notice the excellent effect
of the following which illustrates this kind of treatment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">May It Please Your Honor</span>: I was desired by one of
the court to look into the books, and consider the question
now before them concerning Writs of Assistance. I have
accordingly considered it, and appear not only in obedience
to your order, but likewise in behalf of the inhabitants of this
town, who have presented another petition, and out of regard
to the liberties of the subject. And I take this opportunity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>to declare, that whether under a fee or not (for in such a
cause as this I despise a fee) I will to my dying day oppose
with all the powers and faculties God has given me, all such
instruments of slavery on the one hand and villainy on the
other, as this Writ of Assistance is.</p>

<p>It appears to me the worst instrument of arbitrary power,
the most destructive of English liberty and the fundamental
principles of law, that ever was found in an English law-book.</p>

<p>Informative and argumentative introductions are
quite usual. They abound in legislative bodies, business
organizations, and courts of law. Having definite
purposes to attain they move forward as directly and
clearly as they can. In such appearances a speaker
should know how to lead to his topic quickly, clearly,
convincingly. Introductions should be reduced to
a minimum because time is valuable. Ideas count;
mere talk is worthless.</p>

<p>Attempts at humorous speeches are only too often
the saddest exhibitions of life. The mere recital of
"funny stories" in succession is in no sense speech-making,
although hundreds of misguided individuals
act as though they think so. Nor is a good introduction
the one that begins with a comic incident
supposedly with a point pat to the occasion or topic,
yet so often miles wide of both. The funny story
which misses its mark is a boomerang. Even the
apparently "sure-fire" one may deliver a disturbing
kick to its perpetrator. The grave danger is the
"o'er done or come tardy off" of Hamlet's advice
to the players. Humor must be distinctly marked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>off from the merely comic or witty, and clearly recognized
as a wonderful gift bestowed on not too many
mortals in this world. The scoffing, ironic introduction
may depend upon wit and cleverness born in
the head; the humorous introduction depends upon
a sympathetic instinct treasured in the heart. Look
back at the remarks made by Beecher to his turbulent
disturbers in Liverpool. Did he help his cause by
his genial appreciation of their sentiments?</p>

<p>The student should study several introductions to
speeches in the light of all the preceding discussions
so that he may be able to prepare his own and judge
them intelligently. Printed speeches will provide
material for study, but better still are delivered remarks.
If the student can hear the speech, then
see it in print, so much the better, for he can then
recall the effect in sound of the phrases.</p>

<p><b>Preparing and Delivering Introductions.</b> Actual
practice in preparation and delivery of introductions
should follow. These should be delivered before the
class and should proceed no farther than the adequate
introduction to the hearers of the topic of the speech.
They need not be so fragmentary as to occupy only
three seconds. By supposing them to be beginnings
of speeches from six to fifteen minutes long
these remarks may easily last from one to two
minutes.</p>

<p>Aside from the method of its delivery&mdash;pose,
voice, speed, vocabulary, sentences&mdash;each introduction
should be judged as an actual introduction to a
real speech. Each speaker should keep in mind
these questions to apply during his preparation. Each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>listener should apply them as he hears the introduction
delivered.</p>

<p>
Is the topic introduced gracefully?<br />
Is it introduced clearly?<br />
Is the introduction too long?<br />
Does it begin too far away from the topic?<br />
Is it interesting?<br />
Has it any defects of material?<br />
Has it any faults of manner?<br />
Can any of it be omitted?<br />
Do you want to hear the entire speech?<br />
Can you anticipate the material?<br />
Is it adapted to its audience?<br />
Is it above their heads?<br />
Is it beneath their intelligences?<br />
</p>

<p>Topics for these exercises in delivering introductions
should be furnished by the interests, opinions, ideas,
experiences, ambitions of the students themselves.
Too many beginning speakers cause endless worry
for themselves, lower the quality of their speeches,
bore their listeners, by "hunting" for things to talk
about, when near at hand in themselves and their
activities lie the very best things to discuss. The
over-modest feeling some people have that they know
nothing to talk about is usually a false impression.
In Elizabethan England a young poet, Sir Phillip
Sidney, decided to try to tell his sweetheart how much
he loved her. So he "sought fit words, studying
inventions fine, turning others' leaves, to see if thence
would flow, some fresh and fruitful showers upon
my sunburnt brain." But "words came halting
forth" until he bit his truant pen and almost beat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>himself for spite. Then said the Muse to him, "Fool,
look in thy heart and write." And without that
first word, this is the advice that should be given to
all speakers. "Look in your heart, mind, life, experiences,
ideas, ideals, interests, enthusiasms, and
from them draw the material of your speeches&mdash;<i>yours</i>
because no one else could make that speech,
so essentially and peculiarly is it your own."</p>

<p>The following may serve as suggestions of the
kind of topic to choose and the various methods of
approaching it. They are merely hints, for each
student must adapt his own method and material.</p>

<h3>CONCLUDING THE SPEECH</h3>


<p><b>Preparing the Conclusion.</b> No architect would
attempt to plan a building unless he knew the purpose
for which it was to be used. No writer of a story
would start to put down words until he knew exactly
how his story was to end. He must plan to bring
about a certain conclusion. The hero and heroine
must be united in marriage. The scheming villain
must be brought to justice. Or if he scorn the usual
ending of the "lived happily ever after" kind of
fiction, he can plan to kill his hero and heroine, or
both; or he can decide for once that his story shall
be more like real life than is usually the case, and have
wickedness triumph over virtue. Whatever he elects
to do at the conclusion of his story, whether it be
long or short, the principle of his planning is the
same&mdash;he must know what he is going to do and
adequately prepare for it during the course of, previous
events.</p>

<p>One other thing every writer must secure. The
ending of a book must be the most interesting part of
it. It must rise highest in interest. It must be
surest of appeal. Otherwise the author runs the
risk of not having people read his book through to
its conclusion, and as every book is written in the hope
and expectation that it will be read through, a book
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>which fails to hold the attention of its readers defeats
its own purpose.</p>

<p>The foregoing statements are self-evident but they
are set down because their underlying principles can
be transferred to a consideration of the preparation
of conclusions for speeches.</p>

<p><b>Is a Conclusion Necessary?</b> But before we use them
let us ask whether all speeches require conclusions.</p>

<p>There are some people&mdash;thoughtless, if nothing
worse&mdash;who habitually end letters by adding some
such expression as "Having nothing more to say,
I shall now close." Is there any sense in writing such
a sentence? If the letter comes only so far and the
signature follows, do not those items indicate that
the writer has nothing more to say and is actually
closing? Why then, when a speaker has said all he
has to say, should he not simply stop and sit down?
Will that not indicate quite clearly that he has finished
his speech? What effect would such an ending have?</p>

<p>In the first place the speaker runs the risk of appearing
at least discourteous, if not actually rude,
to his audience. To fling his material at them, then
to leave it so, would impress men and women much
as the brusque exit from a group of people in a room
would or the slamming of a door of an office.</p>

<p>In the second place the speaker runs the graver
risk of not making clear and emphatic the purpose
of his speech. He may have been quite plain and
effective during the course of his explanation or argument
but an audience hears a speech only once. Can
he trust to their recollection of what he has tried to
impress upon them? Will they carry away exactly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>what he wants them to retain? Has he made the
main topics, the chief aim, stand out prominently
enough? Can he merely stop speaking? These are
quite important aspects of a grave responsibility.</p>

<p>In the third place&mdash;though this may be considered
less important than the preceding&mdash;the speaker gives
the impression that he has not actually "finished"
his speech. No one cares for unfinished articles,
whether they be dishes of food, pieces of furniture,
poems, or speeches. Without unduly stressing the
fact that a speech is a carefully organized and constructed
product, it may be stated that it is always
a profitable effort to try to round off your remarks.
A good conclusion gives an impression of completeness,
of an effective product. Audiences are delicately
susceptible to these impressions.</p>

<p>Twenty-two centuries ago Aristotle, in criticizing
Greek oratory, declared that the first purpose of the
conclusion was to conciliate the audience in favor of
the speaker. As human nature has not changed
much in the ages since, the statement still holds true.</p>

<p>Speakers, then, should provide conclusions for all
their speeches.</p>

<p>Although the entire matter of planning the speech
belongs to a later chapter some facts concerning it as
they relate to the conclusion must be set down here.</p>

<p><b>Relation of the Conclusion to the Speech.</b> The
conclusion should reflect the purpose of the speech.
It should enforce the reason for the delivery of the
speech. As it emphasizes the purpose of the speech
it should be in the speaker's mind before he begins
to plan the development of his remarks. It should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>be kept constantly in his mind as he delivers his material.
A train from Chicago bound for New York
is not allowed to turn off on all the switches it meets
in its journey. A speaker who wants to secure from
a jury a verdict for damages from a traction company
does not discuss presidential candidates. He works
towards his conclusion. A legislator who wants votes
to pass a bill makes his conclusion and his speech
conform to that purpose. In all likelihood, his conclusion
plainly asks for the votes he has been proving
that his fellow legislators should cast. A school
principal pleading with boys to stop gambling knows
that his conclusion is going to be a call for a showing
of hands to pledge support of his recommendations.
A labor agitator knows that his conclusion is going
to be an appeal to a sense of class prejudice, so he
speaks with that continually in mind. An efficiency
expert in shop management knows that his conclusion
is going to enforce the saving in damages for injury
by accident if a scheme of safety devices be installed,
so he speaks with that conclusion constantly in his
mind. In court the prosecuting attorney tells in
his introduction exactly what he intends to prove.
His conclusion shows that he has proved what he
announced.</p>

<p>One is tempted to say that the test of a good speech,
a well-prepared speech, is its conclusion. How many
times one hears a speaker floundering along trying
to do something, rambling about, making no impression,
not advancing a pace, and then later receives
from the unfortunate the confession, "I wanted to
stop but I didn't know how to do it." No conclusion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>had been prepared beforehand. It is quite as disturbing
to hear a speaker pass beyond the place where
he could have made a good conclusion. If he realizes
this he slips into the state of the first speaker described
in this paragraph. If he does not realize
when he reaches a good conclusion he talks too long
and weakens the effect by stopping on a lower plane
than he has already reached. This fault corresponds
to the story teller whose book drops in interest at the
end. The son of a minister was asked whether his
father's sermon the previous Sunday had-not had
some good points in it. The boy replied, "Yes,
three good points where he should have stopped."</p>

<p><b>Length of the Conclusion.</b> It must not be inferred
from anything here stated concerning the importance
of the conclusion that it need be long. A good rule
for the length of the conclusion is the same rule that
applies to the length of the introduction. It should
be just long enough to do best what it is intended to
do. As in the case of the introduction, so for the
conclusion, the shorter the better, if consistent with
clearness and effect. If either introduction or conclusion
must deliberately be reduced the conclusion
will stand the most compression. A conclusion will
frequently fail of its effect if it is so long that the
audience anticipates its main points. It fails if it is
so long that it adds nothing of clearness or emphasis
to the speech itself. It will end by boring if it is too
long for the importance of its material. It will often
produce a deeper, more lasting impression by its very
conciseness. Brevity is the soul of more than mere
humor. A brief remark will cut deeper than a long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>involved sentence. The speaker who had shown that
the recent great war fails unless the reconstruction
to be accomplished is worthy needed no more involved
conclusion than the statement, "It is what we do tomorrow
that will justify what we did yesterday."</p>

<p>Coupled with this matter of effect is the length of
the speech itself. Short speeches are likely to require
only short conclusions. Long speeches more naturally
require longer conclusions.</p>

<p>Consider the following conclusions. Comment upon
them. It would be interesting to try to decide the
length of the speeches from which they are taken,
then look at the originals, all of which are easily procurable
at libraries.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>That is in substance my theory of what our foreign policy
should be. Let us not boast, not insult any one, but make
up our minds coolly what it is necesary to say, say it, and
then stand to it, whatever the consequences may be.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span> at Waukesha, 1903</p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing is quite matter-of-fact. It contains
no emotional appeal at all. Yet even a strong emotional
feeling can be put into a short conclusion. From
the date and the circumstances surrounding the next
the reader can easily picture for himself the intense
emotion of the audience which listened to these words
from the leader of the free states against the South.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations
against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction
to the government, nor of dungeons to ourselves.
Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith
let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>While the student planning his own speech must
determine exactly what he shall put into his conclusion&mdash;depending
always upon his material and his purpose&mdash;there
are a few general hints which will help
him.</p>

<p><b>The Retrospective Conclusion.</b> A conclusion may
be entirely retrospective. This means merely that
it may refer back to the remarks which have been
delivered in the body of the speech. A speaker does
this to emphasize something he has already discussed
by pointing out to his audience that he wants them
to remember that from what he has said. Conclusions
of this kind usually have no emotional appeal.
They are likely to be found in explanatory
addresses, where the clearness of the exposition should
make hearers accept it as true. If a man has proven
a fact&mdash;as in a law court&mdash;he does not have to make
an appeal to feeling to secure a verdict. Juries are
supposed to decide on the facts alone. This kind of
conclusion emphasizes, repeats, clarifies, enforces. The
first of the following is a good illustration of one
kind of conclusion which refers to the remarks
made in the speech proper. Notice that it enforces
the speaker's opinions by a calm explanation of his
sincerity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I want you to think of what I have said, because it represents
all of the sincerity and earnestness that I have, and I
say to you here, from this platform, nothing that I have not
already stated in effect, and nothing I would not say at a
private table with any of the biggest corporation managers
in the land.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span> at Fitchburg, 1902</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>The next, while it is exactly the same kind in material,
adds some elements of stronger feeling. Yet
in the main it also enforces the speaker's opinion by a
clear explanation of his action. From this conclusion
alone we know exactly the material and purpose of
the entire speech.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir, I will detain you no longer. There are some parts of
this bill which I highly approve; there are others in which
I should acquiesce; but those to which I have now stated
my objections appear to me so destitute of all justice, so
burdensome and so dangerous to that interest which has
steadily enriched, gallantly defended, and proudly distinguished
us, that nothing can prevail upon me to give it my
support.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Daniel Webster</span>: <i>The Tariff</i>, 1824</p>
</div>

<p><b>The Anticipatory Conclusion.</b> Just as a conclusion
may be retrospective, so it may be anticipatory. It
may start from the position defined or explained or
reached by the speech and look forward to what may
happen, what must be done, what should be instituted,
what should be changed, what votes should
be cast, what punishment should be inflicted, what
pardons granted. The student should make a list
of all possible things in the future which could be
anticipated in the conclusions of various speeches.
If one will think of the purposes of most delivered
speeches he will realize that this kind of conclusion
is much more frequent than the previous kind as so
many speeches anticipate future action or events.
Dealing with entirely different topics the three following
extracts illustrate this kind of conclusion.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>Washington was arguing against the formation of
parties in the new nation, trying to avert the inevitable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is an opinion that parties in free countries are
useful checks upon the administration of the government,
and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within
certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a
monarchical cast, patriotism may look with indulgence if
not with favor upon the spirit of party. But in those of the
popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a
spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency
it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for
every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger
of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to
mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands
a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a
flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.</p>

<p>With the dignity and the calmness of the preceding,
contrast the Biblical fervor of the next&mdash;the magnanimous
program of the reuniter of a divided people.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness
in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive
on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's
wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle,
and for his widow and his orphan&mdash;to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves,
and with all nations.</p>

</div>

<p>In totally different circumstances the next conclusion
was delivered, yet it bears the same aspect of anticipation.
There is not a single hint in it of the
material of the speech which preceded it, it takes no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>glance backward, it looks forward only. Its effectiveness
comes from the element of leadership, that
gesture of pointing the way for loyal Americans to
follow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>No nation as great as ours can expect to escape the penalty
of greatness, for greatness does not come without trouble
and labor. There are problems ahead of us at home and
problems abroad, because such problems are incident to the
working out of a great national career. We do not shrink
from them. Scant is our patience with those who preach
the gospel of craven weakness. No nation under the sun
ever yet played a part worth playing if it feared its fate overmuch&mdash;if
it did not have the courage to be great. We of
America, we, the sons of a nation yet in the pride of its
lusty youth, spurn the teachings of distrust, spurn the creed
of failure and despair. We know that the future is ours
if we have in us the manhood to grasp it, and we enter the
new century girding our loins for the contest before us, rejoicing
in the struggle, and resolute so to bear ourselves that
the nation's future shall even surpass her glorious past.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Theodore Roosevelt</span> at Philadelphia, 1902</p>
</div>

<p>Grave times always make men look into the future.
All acts are judged and justified after they are performed.
All progress depends upon this straining
the vision into the darkness of the yet-to-be. Upon
the eve of great struggles anticipation is always uppermost
in men's minds. In the midst of the strife it
is man's hope. In the next extract, only one sentence
glances backward.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For us there is but one choice. We have made it. Woe
be to the man or group of men that seeks to stand in our way
in this day of high resolution when every principle we hold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>dearest is to be vindicated and made secure for the salvation
of the nations. We are ready to plead at the bar of history,
and our flag shall wear a new luster. Once more we shall
make good with our lives and fortunes the great faith to
which we were born, and a new glory shall shine in the face

<p><b>Retrospective and Anticipatory Conclusion.</b> While
it does not occur so frequently as the two kinds just
illustrated it is possible for a conclusion to be both
retrospective and anticipatory&mdash;to look both backward
and forward. The conclusion may enforce what
the speech has declared or proved, then using this
position as a safe starting point for a new departure,
look forward and indicate what may follow or what
should be done. The only danger in such an attempt
is that the dual aspect may be difficult to make effective.
Either one may neutralize the other. Still, a
careful thinker and master of clear language may be
able to carry an audience with him in such a treatment.
The division in the conclusion between the
backward glance and the forward vision need not be
equal. Here again the effect to be made upon the
audience, the purpose of the speech, must be the determining
factor. Notice how the two are blended
in the following conclusion from a much read commemorative
oration.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And now, friends and fellow-citizens, it is time to bring
this discourse to a close.</p>

<p>We have indulged in gratifying recollections of the past,
in the prosperity and pleasures of the present, and in high
hopes for the future. But let us remember that we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>duties and obligations to perform, corresponding to the
blessings which we enjoy. Let us remember the trust, the
sacred trust, attaching to the rich inheritance which we have
received from our fathers. Let us feel our personal responsibility,
to the full extent of our power and influence, for
the preservation of the principles of civil and religious
liberty. And let us remember that it is only religion, and
morals, and knowledge, that can make men respectable,
under any form of government....</p>

<p>Conclusions are classified in general under three
headings: 1. Recapitulation; 2. Summary; 3. Peroration.</p>

<p><b>The Recapitulation.</b> The first of these&mdash;recapitulation&mdash;is
exactly defined by the etymology of
the word itself. Its root is Latin <i>caput</i>, head. So
recapitulation means the repetition of the heads or
main topics of a preceding discussion. Coming at
the end of an important speech of some length, such a
conclusion is invaluable. If the speaker has explained
clearly or reasoned convincingly his audience will
have been enlightened or convinced. Then at the
end, to assure them they are justified in their knowledge
or conviction, he repeats in easily remembered sequence
the heads which he has treated in his extended remarks.
It is as though he chose from his large assortment a
small package which he does up neatly for his audience
to carry away with them. Frequently, too, the recapitulation
corresponds exactly to the plan as announced
in the introduction and followed throughout
the speech. This firmly impresses the main points
upon the brains of the hearers.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>A lawyer in court starts by announcing that he will
prove a certain number of facts. After his plea is
finished, in the conclusion of his speech, he recapitulates,
showing that he has proved these things. A minister,
a political candidate, a business man, a social worker&mdash;in
fact, every speaker will find such a clear-cut
listing an informative, convincing manner of constructing
a conclusion. This extract shows a clear,
direct, simple recapitulation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To recapitulate what has been said, we maintain, first,
that the Constitution, by its grants to Congress and its prohibitions
on the states, has sought to establish one uniform
standard of value, or medium of payment. Second, that,
by like means, it has endeavored to provide for one uniform
mode of discharging debts, when they are to be discharged
without payment. Third, that these objects are connected,
and that the first loses much of its importance, if the last,
also, be not accomplished. Fourth, that, reading the grant
to Congress and the prohibition on the States together, the
inference is strong that the Constitution intended to confer
an exclusive power to pass bankrupt laws on Congress.
Fifth, that the prohibition in the tenth section reaches to
all contracts, existing or future, in the same way that the
other prohibition, in the same section, extends to all debts,
existing or future. Sixth, that, upon any other construction,
one great political object of the Constitution will fail of its
accomplishment.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Summary</b>. The second kind&mdash;a summary&mdash;does
somewhat the same thing that the recapitulation
does, but it effects it in a different matter. Note that
the recapitulation <i>repeats</i> the main headings of the
speech; it usually uses the same or similar phrasing.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>The summary does not do this. The summary condenses
the entire material of the speech, so that it is
presented to the audience in shortened, general statements,
sufficient to recall to them what the speaker
has already presented, without actually repeating his
previous statements. This kind of conclusion is
perhaps more usual than the preceding one. It is
known by a variety of terms&mdash;summing up, resume,
epitome, review, precis, condensation.</p>

<p>In the first of the subjoined illustrations notice
that the words "possible modes" contain practically
all the speech itself. So the four words at the end,
"faction, corruption, anarchy, and despotism," hold
a great deal of the latter part of the speech. These
expressions do not repeat the heads of divisions; they
condense long passages. The extract is a summary.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have thus presented all possible modes in which a government
founded upon the will of an absolute majority will be
modified; and have demonstrated that, in all its forms,
whether in a majority of the people, as in a mere democracy,
or in a majority of their representatives, without a constitution,
to be interpreted as the will of the majority, the
result will be the same: two hostile interests will inevitably
be created by the action of the government, to be followed
by hostile legislation, and that by faction, corruption,
anarchy, and despotism.</p>

<p>From the following pick out the expressions which
summarize long passages of the preceding speech.
Amplify them to indicate what they might cover.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I firmly believe in my countrymen, and therefore I believe
that the chief thing necessary in order that they shall work
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>together is that they shall know one another&mdash;that the
Northerner shall know the Southerner, and the man of one
occupation know the man of another occupation; the man
who works in one walk of life know the man who works in
another walk of life, so that we may realize that the things
which divide us are superficial, are unimportant, and that
we are, and must ever be, knit together into one indissoluble
mass by our common American brotherhood.</p>

</div>

<p><b>The Peroration.</b> A peroration is a conclusion
which&mdash;whatever may be its material and treatment&mdash;has
an appeal to the feelings, to the emotions.
It strives to move the audience to act, to arouse them
to an expression of their wills, to stir them to deeds.
It usually comes at the end of a speech of persuasion.
It appeals to sentiments of right, justice, humanity,
religion. It seldom merely concludes a speech; it
looks forward to some such definite action as casting
a vote, joining an organization or movement, contributing
money, going out on strike, returning to
work, pledging support, signing a petition.</p>

<p>These purposes suggest its material. It is usually
a direct appeal, personal and collective, to all the
hearers. Intense in feeling, tinged with emotion, it
justifies itself by its sincerity and honesty alone. Its
apparent success is not the measure of its merit. Too
frequently an appeal to low prejudices, class sentiment
and prejudice, base motives, mob instincts will carry a
group of people in a certain direction with as little sense
and reason as a flock of sheep display. Every student
can cite a dozen instances of such unwarranted and
unworthy responses to skilful perverted perorations.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>Answering to its emotional tone the style of a peroration
is likely to rise above the usual, to become less
simple, less direct. In this temptation for the speaker
lies a second danger quite as grave as the one just
indicated. In an attempt to wax eloquent he is likely
to become grandiloquent, bombastic, ridiculous. Many
an experienced speaker makes an unworthy exhibition
of himself under such circumstances. One specimen
of such nonsense will serve as a warning.</p>

<p>When the terms for the use of the Panama Canal
were drawn up there arose a discussion as to certain
kinds of ships which might pass through the canal
free of tolls. A treaty with Great Britain prevented
tolls-exemption for privately owned vessels. In a
speech in Congress upon this topic one member delivered
the following inflated and inconsequential
peroration. Can any one with any sanity see any
connection of the Revolutionary War, Jefferson,
Valley Forge, with a plain understanding of such a
business matter as charging tolls for the use of a waterway?
To get the full effect of this piece of "stupendous
folly"&mdash;to quote the speaker's own words&mdash;
the student should declaim it aloud with as much
attempt at oratorical effect as its author expended
upon it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now, may the God of our fathers, who nerved 3,000,000
backwoods Americans to fling their gage of battle into the
face of the mightiest monarch in the world, who guided the
hand of Jefferson in writing the charter of liberty, who sustained
Washington and his ragged and starving army amid
the awful horrors of Valley Forge, and who gave them complete
victory on the blood-stained heights of Yorktown, may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>He lead members to vote so as to prevent this stupendous folly&mdash;this
unspeakable humiliation of the American republic.</p></div>

<p>When the circumstances are grave enough to justify
impassioned language a good speaker need not fear
its effect. If it be suitable, honest, and sincere, a
peroration may be as emotional as human feelings
dictate. So-called "flowery language" seldom is the
medium of deep feeling. The strongest emotions
may be expressed in the simplest terms. Notice how,
in the three extracts here quoted, the feeling is more
intense in each succeeding one. Analyze the style.
Consider the words, the phrases, the sentences in
length and structure. Explain the close relation of
the circumstances and the speaker with the material
and the style. What was the purpose of each?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir, let it be to the honor of Congress that in these days
of political strife and controversy, we have laid aside for once
the sin that most easily besets us, and, with unanimity of counsel,
and with singleness of heart and of purpose, have accomplished
for our country one measure of unquestionable good.</p>

<p>Lord Chatham addressed the House of Lords in
protest against the inhumanities of some of the early
British efforts to suppress the American Revolution.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I call upon that right reverend bench, those holy ministers
of the Gospel, and pious pastors of our Church&mdash;I conjure
them to join in the holy work, and vindicate the religion of
their God. I appeal to the wisdom and law of this learned
bench, to defend and support the justice of their country.
I call upon the Bishops to interpose the unsullied sanctity
of their lawn; upon the learned Judges, to interpose their
purity upon the honor of your Lordships, to reverence the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>dignity of your ancestors and to maintain your own. I call
upon the spirit and humanity of my country, to vindicate the
national character. I invoke the genius of the Constitution.
From the tapestry that adorns these walls the immortal
ancestor of this noble Lord frowns with indignation at the
disgrace of his country....</p>

<p>I again call upon your Lordships, and the united powers
of the state, to examine it thoroughly and decisively, and
to stamp upon it an indelible stigma of the public abhorrence.
And I again implore those holy prelates of our religion to do
away with these iniquities from among us! Let them perform
a lustration; let them purify this House, and this country,
from this sin.</p>

<p>My Lords, I am old and weak, and at present unable to say
more; but my feelings and indignation were too strong to
have said less. I could not have slept this night in my bed,
nor reposed my head on my pillow, without giving vent to
my eternal abhorrence of such preposterous and enormous
principles.</p></div>

<p>At about the same time the same circumstances
evoked several famous speeches, one of which ended
with this well-known peroration.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is in vain, Sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen
may cry, Peace, Peace&mdash;but there is no peace. The war
is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the North
will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our
brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle?
What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have?
Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I
know not what course others may take; but as for me, give
me liberty or give me death!</p>

<p><b>Preparing and Delivering Conclusions.</b> Students
cannot very well be asked to prepare and deliver
conclusions to speeches which do not yet exist, so there
is no way of devising conclusions until later. But
students should report upon conclusions to speeches
they have recently listened to, and explain to the
class their opinions concerning their material, methods,
treatment, delivery, effect. The following questions
will help in judging and criticizing:</p>

<p>
Was the conclusion too long?<br />
Was it so short as to seem abrupt?<br />
Did it impress the audience?<br />
How could it have been improved?<br />
Was it recapitulation, summary, peroration?<br />
Was it retrospective, anticipatory, or both?<br />
What was its relation to the main part of the speech?<br />
Did it refer to the entire speech or only a portion?<br />
What was its relation to the introduction?<br />
Did the speech end where it began?<br />
Did it end as it began?<br />
Was the conclusion in bad taste?<br />
What was its style?<br />
What merits had it?<br />
What defects?<br />
What suggestions could you offer for its improvement?<br />
With reference to the earlier parts of the speech, how was it delivered?<br />
</p>

<p>The following conclusions should be studied from
all the angles suggested in this chapter and previous
ones. An air of reality will be secured if they are memorized
and spoken before the class.</p>

There are so many people in Washington who know things

about. I have to come away and get reminded of the rest
of the country. I have to come away and talk to men who
are up against the real thing and say to them, "I am with
you if you are with me." And the only test of being with
me is not to think about me personally at all, but merely
to think of me as the expression for the time being of the
power and dignity and hope of the United States.</p>

<p>5. Literature has its permanent marks. It is a connected
growth and its life history is unbroken. Masterpieces
have never been produced by men who have had no masters.
Reverence for good work is the foundation of literary character.
The refusal to praise bad work or to imitate it is an
author's professional chastity.</p>

<p>Good work is the most honorable and lasting thing in
the world. Four elements enter into good work in literature:&mdash;</p>

<p>An original impulse&mdash;not necessarily a new idea, but
a new sense of the value of an idea.</p>

<p>A first-hand study of the subject and material.</p>

<p>A patient, joyful, unsparing labor for the perfection
of form.</p>

<p>A human aim&mdash;to cheer, console, purify, or ennoble
the life of the people. Without this aim literature has never
sent an arrow close to the mark.</p>

<p>It is only by good work that men of letters can justify
their right to a place in the world. The father of Thomas
Carlyle was a stone-mason, whose walls stood true and needed
no rebuilding. Carlyle's prayer was: "Let me write my
books as he built his houses."</p>

<p>6. All this, I know well enough, will sound wild and
chimerical to the profane herd of those vulgar and mechanical
politicians who have no place among us&mdash;a sort of people
who think that nothing exists but what is gross and material;
and who, therefore, far from being qualified to be directors
of the great movement of empire, are unfit to turn a wheel
in the machine. But to men truly initiated and rightly
taught, these ruling and master principles, which in the
opinion of such men as I have mentioned have no substantial
existence, are in truth everything and all in all. Magnanimity
in politics is not seldom the truest wisdom: and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>a great empire and little minds go ill together. If we are
conscious of our station, and glow with zeal to fill our places
as becomes our situation and ourselves, we ought to auspicate
all our public proceedings on America with the old warning
of the church, <i>Sursum corda!</i> We ought to elevate our minds
to the greatness of that trust to which the order of Providence
has called us. By adverting to the dignity of this
high calling, our ancestors have turned a savage wilderness
into a glorious empire; and have made the most extensive,
and the only honorable conquests, not by destroying, but
by promoting the wealth, the number, the happiness of the
human race. Let us get an American revenue as we have got
an American empire. English privileges have made it all
that it is; English privileges alone will make it all it can be.</p>

A supreme moment of history has come. The eyes of the

the maintenance of law and the establishment of order and
the foundations of civilization with the vitalizing forces
that make for civilization. And we must constantly direct
our purpose and our policies to the time when the whole
world shall have become civilized; when men, families, communities,
will yield to reason and to conscience. And then
we will draw our sword Excalibur from its sheath and fling
it out into the sea, rejoicing that it is gone forever.</p>

<p>17. A public spirit so lofty is not confined to other lands.
You are conscious of its stirrings in your soul. It calls you
to courageous service, and I am here to bid you obey the call.
Such patriotism may be yours. Let it be your parting vow
that it shall be yours. Bolingbroke described a patriot king
in England; I can imagine a patriot president in America.
I can see him indeed the choice of a party, and called to administer
the government when sectional jealousy is fiercest
and party passion most inflamed. I can imagine him seeing
clearly what justice and humanity, the national law and the
national welfare require him to do, and resolved to do it. I
can imagine him patiently enduring not only the mad cry
of party hate, the taunt of "recreant" and "traitor," of
"renegade" and "coward," but what is harder to bear, the
amazement, the doubt, the grief, the denunciation, of those
as sincerely devoted as he to the common welfare. I can
imagine him pushing firmly on, trusting the heart, the intelligence,
the conscience of his countrymen, healing angry
wounds, correcting misunderstandings, planting justice on
surer foundations, and, whether his party rise or fall, lifting
his country heavenward to a more perfect union, prosperity,
and peace. This is the spirit of a patriotism that girds the
commonwealth with the resistless splendor of the moral
law&mdash;the invulnerable panoply of states, the celestial secret
of a great nation and a happy people.</p>

<h3>GETTING MATERIAL</h3>


<p><b>The Material of Speeches.</b> So far this book has
dealt almost entirely with the manner of speaking.
Now it comes to the relatively more important consideration
of the material of speech. Necessary as
it is that a speaker shall know how to speak, it is
much more valuable that he shall know what to speak.
We frequently hear it said of a speaker, "It wasn't
what he said, it was the way he said it," indicating
clearly that the striking aspect of the delivery was
his manner; but even when this remark is explained
it develops frequently that there was some value in
the material, as well as some charm or surprise or
novelty in the method of expression. In the last
and closest analysis a speech is valuable for what it
conveys to its hearers' minds, what it induces them
to do, not what temporary effects of charm and entertainment
it affords.</p>

<p>Persons of keen minds and cultivated understandings
have come away from gatherings addressed by
men famous as good speech-makers and confessed
to something like the following: "I was held spellbound
all the time he was talking, but for the life of
me, I can't tell you one thing he said or one idea he
impressed upon me." A student should judge speeches
he hears with such things in mind, so that he can hold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>certain ones up as models, and discard others as
"horrible examples."</p>

<p>It should be the rule that before a man attempts
to speak he should have something to say. This is
apparently not always the case. Many a man tries
to say something when he simply has nothing at all
to say. Recall the description of Gratiano's talk,
quoted earlier in this book.</p>

<p>A speaker then must have material. He must get
material. The clergyman knows that he must deliver
about a hundred sermons a year. The lawyer knows
he must go into court on certain days. The lecturer
must instruct his various audiences. The business
man must address executive boards, committees,
conventions, customers. The student must address
classes, societies. The beginner in speech training
must seize every opportunity to talk. Certainly the
natural reserve stock of ideas and illustrations will
soon be exhausted, or it will grow so stale that it will
be delivered ineffectively, or it will be unsuitable to
every occasion. A celebrated Frenchman, called upon
unexpectedly to speak, excused himself by declaring,
"What is suitable to say I do not know, and what I
know is not suitable."</p>

<p><b>Getting Material.</b> There are three ways of getting
material. The first is by observation, the second by
interview, the third by reading.</p>

<p><b>Observation.</b> The value of securing material by
observation is apparent at first glance. That which
you have experienced you know. That which you
have seen with your own eyes you can report correctly.
That which has happened to you you can relate with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>the aspect of absolute truth. That which you have
done you can teach others to do. That which has
touched you you can explain correctly. That which
you know to be the fact is proof against all attack.</p>

<p>These are the apparent advantages of knowledge
gained at first hand. The faculty of accurate observation
is one of the most satisfying that can enter
into a person's mental equipment. It can be trained,
broadened, and made more and more accurate. In
some trades and professions it is an indispensable
part of one's everyday ability. The faculty may be
easily developed by exercise and test for accuracy.</p>

<p>Everyone acknowledges the weight and significance
of material gained by observation. In America especially
we accord attention and regard to the reports
and accounts made by men who have done things,
the men who have experienced the adventures they
relate. There is such a vividness, a reality, a conviction
about these personal utterances that we must
listen respectfully and applaud sincerely. Magazines
and newspapers offer hundreds of such articles for
avid readers. Hundreds of books each year are
based upon such material.</p>

<p>With all its many advantages the field of observation
is limited. Not every person can experience
or see all he is interested in and wants to talk about.
We must choose presidents but we cannot observe
the candidates themselves and their careers. We
must have opinions about the League of Nations,
the Mexican situation, the radical labor movements,
the changing taxes, but we cannot observe all phases
of these absorbing topics. If we restrict speeches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>to only what we can observe we shall all be uttering
merely trivial personalities based upon no general
knowledge and related to none of the really important
things in the universe.</p>

<p>Nor is it always true that the person who does a
thing can report it clearly and accurately. Ask a
woman or girl how she hemstitches a handkerchief,
or a boy how he swims or throws a curve, and note the
involved and inaccurate accounts. If you doubt
this, explain one of these to the class. It is not easy
to describe exactly what one has seen, mainly because
people do not see accurately. People usually see
what they want to see, what they are predisposed to
see. Witnesses in court, testifying upon oath concerning
an accident, usually produce as many different
versions as there are pairs of eyes. Books upon
psychology report many enlightening and amusing
cases of this defect of accurate observation in people.

Good cases are related by Swift, E.J.: <i>Psychology and the Day's Work</i>.</p></div>

<p>The two negative aspects of material secured in
this first manner&mdash;1, limited range of observation,
2, inaccuracy of observation&mdash;placed beside the
advantages already listed will clearly indicate in
what subjects and circumstances this method should
be relied upon for securing material for speeches.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Make a list of recent articles based upon observation
which you have seen or read in newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>2. With what kind of material does each deal?</p>

<p>3. Which article is best? Why?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>4. List four topics upon which your observation has given
you material which could be used in a speech.</p>

<p>5. What kind of speech? A speech for what purpose?</p>

<p>6. Consider and weigh the value of your material.</p>

<p>7. Why is it good?</p>

<p>8. What limits, or drawbacks has it?</p>

<p>9. What could be said against it from the other side?</p>

<p><b>Interview.</b> If a person cannot himself experience
or observe all he wants to use for material his first
impulse will be to interview people who have had
experience themselves. In this circumstance the
speaker becomes the reporter of details of knowledge
furnished by others. The value of this is apparent
at once. Next to first-hand knowledge, second-hand
knowledge will serve admirably.</p>

<p>Every newspaper and magazine in the world uses
this method because its readers' first query, mental or
expressed, of all its informative articles is "Is this
true?" If the author is merely repeating the experience
of an acknowledged expert in the field under
discussion, the value of the interview cannot be
questioned. In this case the resulting report is almost
as good as the original testimony or statement of the
man who knows.</p>

<p>The first requisite, therefore, of material gathered
in such a manner is that it be reproduced exactly as
first delivered. The man who told a woman that a
critic had pronounced her singing "heavenly" had
good intentions but he was not entirely accurate in
changing to that nattering term the critic's actual
adjective "unearthly." The frequency with which
alleged statements published in the daily press are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>contradicted by the supposed utterers indicates how
usual such misrepresentation is, though it may be
honestly unintentional. The speaker before an audience
must be scrupulously correct in quoting. This
accuracy is not assured unless a stenographic transcript
be taken at the time the information is given, or unless
the person quoted reads the sentiments and statements
credited to him and expresses his approval.</p>

<p>Signed statements, personal letters, printed records,
photographs, certified copies, and other exhibits of
all kinds are employed to substantiate material secured
from interviews and offered in speeches. If you notice
newspaper accounts of lectures, political speeches,
legislative procedure, legal practice, you will soon
become familiar with such usages as are described
by the expressions, filing as part of the record, taking
of a deposition in one city for use in a lawsuit in
another, Exhibit A, photograph of an account book,
statement made in the presence of a third party, as
recorded by a dictaphone, etc.</p>

<p>The first danger in securing material by the personal
interview is the natural error of misunderstanding.
The second danger is the natural desire&mdash;not necessarily
false, at that&mdash;to interpret to the user's benefit,
the material so secured, or to the discredit of all
views other than his own. It is so easy, so tempting,
in making out a strong case for one's own opinions
to omit the slight concession which may grant ever
so little shade of right to other beliefs. Judicious
manipulation of any material may degenerate into
mere juggling for support. Quotations and reports,
like statistics, can be made to prove anything, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>general intellectual distrust of mere numbers is cleverly
summed up in the remark, "Figures can't lie, but liars
can figure."</p>

<p>To have the material accepted as of any weight or
value the person from whom it is secured must be
recognized as an authority. He must be of such eminence
in the field for which his statements are quoted
as not only to be accepted by the speaker using his
material but as unqualifiedly recognized by all the
opponents of the speaker. His remarks must have
the definiteness of the expert witness whose testimony
in court carries so much weight. To secure due consideration,
the speaker must make perfectly clear to
his audience the position of his authority, his fitness
to be quoted, his unquestioned knowledge, sincerity,
and honesty.</p>

<p>Knowledge secured in this manner may be used
with signal effect in a speech, either to supply all the
material or to cover certain portions. If you listen
to many speeches (and you should), notice how often
a speaker introduces the result of his interviews&mdash;formal
or merely conversational&mdash;with persons whose
statement he is certain will impress his audience.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Make a list of five topics of which you know so little
that you would have to secure information by interviews.</p>

<p>2. Of these choose two, define your opinion or feeling in
each, and tell to whom you could apply for material.</p>

<p>3. Choose one dealing with some topic of current interest
in your locality; define your own opinion or feeling, and tell
to whom you could apply for material.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>
<p>4. Explain exactly why you name this person.</p>

<p>5. Prepare a set of questions to bring out material to
support your position.</p>

<p>6. Prepare some questions to draw out material to dispose
of other views.</p>

<p>7. Interview some person upon one of the foregoing topics
or a different one, and in a speech present this material before
the class.</p>

<p>8. In general discussion comment on the authorities
reported and the material presented.</p>

<p><b>Reading.</b> The best way and the method most
employed for gathering material is reading. Every
user of material in speeches must depend upon his
reading for the greatest amount of his knowledge.
The old expression "reading law" shows how most
legal students secured the information upon which
their later practice was based. Nearly all real study
of any kind depends upon wide and careful reading.</p>

<p>Reading, in the sense here used, differs widely from
the entertaining perusal of current magazines, or the
superficial skimming through short stories or novels.
Reading for material is done with a more serious purpose
than merely killing time, and is regulated according
to certain methods which have been shown to produce
the best results for the effort and time expended.</p>

<p>The speaker reads for the single purpose of securing
material to serve his need in delivered remarks. He
has a definite aim. He must know how to serve that
end. Not everyone who can follow words upon a
printed page can read in this sense. He must be
able to read, understand, select, and retain. The
direction is heard in some churches to "read, mark,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>learn, and inwardly digest." This is a picturesque
phrasing of the same principles.</p>

<p>You must know how to read. Have you often in
your way through a book suddenly realized at the
bottom of a page that you haven't the slightest recollection
of what your eye has been over? You may
have felt this same way after finishing a chapter.
People often read poetry in this manner. This is not
really reading. The speaker who reads for material
must concentrate. If he reaches the bottom of a page
without an idea, he must go back to get it. It is
better not to read too rapidly the first time, in order
to save this repetition. The ability to read is trained
in exactly the same way as any other ability. Accuracy
first, speed later. Perhaps the most prevalent
fault of students of all kinds is lack of concentration.</p>

<p><b>Understanding.</b> After reading comes understanding.
To illustrate this, poetry again might be cited,
for any one can <i>read</i> poetry, though many declare
they cannot understand it. The simplest looking
prose may be obscure to the mind which is slow in
comprehending. When we read we get general ideas,
cursory impressions; we catch the drift of the author's
meaning. Reading for material must be more thorough
than that. It must not merely believe it understands;
it must preclude the slightest possibility of
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>A reader who finds in a printed speech approval
of a system of <i>representation</i> but a condemnation of
a system of <i>representatives</i> must grasp at once, or must
work out for himself, the difference between these
two: the first meaning a relationship only, the second
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>meaning men serving as delegates. When he meets
an unusual word like <i>mandatory</i>, he must not be content
to guess at its significance by linking it with <i>command</i>
and <i>mandate</i>, for as used in international affairs
it means something quite definite. To secure this
complete understanding of all his reading he will
consult consistently every book of reference. He
should read with a good dictionary at his elbow, and
an atlas and an encyclopedia within easy reach. If
he is able to talk over with others what he reads, explaining
to them what is not clear, he will have an
excellent method of testing his own understanding.
The old-fashioned practice of "saying lessons over"
at home contributed to this growth of a pupil's understanding.</p>

<p><b>Selecting.</b> Third, the reader for material must
know how to select. As he usually reads to secure
information or arguments for a certain definite purpose,
he will save time by knowing quickly what not
to read. All that engages his attention without
directly contributing to his aim is wasting time and
energy. He must learn how to use books. If he
cannot handle alphabetized collections quickly he is
wasting time. If he does not know how material is
arranged he will waste both time and energy. He
must know books.</p>

<p>Every printed production worthy of being called
a book should have an index. Is the index the same
as the table of contents? The table of contents is
printed at the beginning of the volume. It is a synopsis,
by chapter headings or more detailed topics, of
the plan of the book. It gives a general outline of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>the contents of the book. You are interested in
public speaking. You wonder whether a book contains
a chapter on debating. Does this one? You
notice that a speaker used a series of jerky gesticulations.
You wonder whether this book contains a
chapter upon gestures. Does it?</p>

<p>The table of contents is valuable for the purposes
just indicated. It appears always at the beginning
of a work. If the work fills more than one volume,
the table of contents is sometimes given for all of them
in the first; sometimes it is divided among the volumes;
sometimes both arrangements are combined.</p>

<p>The table of contents is never so valuable as the
index. This always comes at the end of the book.
If the work is in more than one volume the index
comes at the <i>end of the last volume</i>. What did you
learn of the topic <i>gestures</i> in this book from your reference
to the table of contents? Now look at the index.
What does the index do for a topic? If a topic is
treated in various parts of a long work the volumes are
indicated by Roman numerals, the pages by ordinary
numerals.</p>

<p>Interpret this entry taken from the index of <i>A History
of the United States</i> by H.W. Elson.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p><b>Retaining Knowledge.</b> The only valid test of the
reader's real equipment is what he retains and can
use. How much of what you read do you remember?
The answer depends upon education, training in this
particular exercise, and lapse of time. What method
of remembering do you find most effective in your
own case? To answer this you should give some
attention to your own mind. What kind of mind
have you? Do you retain most accurately what you
see? Can you reproduce either exactly or in correct
substance what you read to yourself without any
supporting aids to stimulate your memory? If you
have this kind of mind develop it along that line. Do
not weaken its power by letting it lean on any supports
at all. If you find you can do without them,
do not get into the habit of taking notes. If you
can remember to do everything you should do during
a trip downtown don't make a list of the items before
you go. If you can retain from a single reading the
material you are gathering, don't make notes. Impress
things upon your memory faculty. Develop
that ability in yourself.</p>

<p>Have you a different kind of mind, the kind which
remember best what it tells, what it explains, what
it does? Do you fix things in your brain by performing
them? Does information become rooted in
your memory because you have imparted it to others?
If so you should secure the material you gather from
your reading by adapting some method related to
the foregoing. You may talk it over with some one
else, you may tell it aloud to yourself, you may imagine
you are before an audience and practise impressing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>them with what you want to retain. Any device
which successfully fixes knowledge in your memory
is legitimate. You should know enough about your
own mental processes to find for yourself the best
and quickest way. It is often said of teachers that
they do not actually feel that they <i>know</i> a subject
until they have tried to teach it to others.</p>

<p><b>Taking Notes.</b> Another kind of mind recalls or
remembers material it has read when some note or
hint suggests all of it. This kind of mind depends
upon the inestimably valuable art of note-taking, a
method quite as worthy as the two just considered if
its results justify its employment. Note-taking does
not mean a helter-skelter series of exclamatory jottings.
It means a well-planned, regularly organized series of
entries so arranged that reference to any portion recalls
vividly and exactly the full material of the original.
Books and speeches are well planned. They follow
a certain order. Notes based upon them should
reproduce that plan and show the relative value of
parts.</p>

<p>When completed, such notes, arranged in outline
form, should enable the maker to reproduce the extended
material from which they were made. If he
cannot do that, his reading and his note-taking were
to little purpose. A speaker who has carefully written
out his full speech and delivers it form the manuscript
can use that speech over and over again. But that
does not indicate that he really <i>knows</i> much about
the topic he is discussing. He did know about it
once. But the man who from a series of notes can
reconstruct material worked up long before proves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>that he has retained his knowledge of it. Besides,
this method gives him the chance to adapt his
presentation to the changing conditions and the new
audience.</p>

<p>In using this method, when a particularly important
bit of information is met, it should be set down very
carefully, usually verbatim, as it may be quoted
exactly in the speech. This copy may be made upon
the paper where the regular notes are being entered
so that it may be found later embodied in the material
it supports. Or it may later be cut from this sheet
to be shifted about and finally fixed when planning
the speech, or preparing the outline (discussed in the
next two chapters). Many practised speech-makers
copy such material upon the regularly sized library
catalog cards (3 by 5 inches), some distinguishing by the
colors of cards the various kinds of material, such as
arguments supporting a position, opposite arguments,
refutation, statistics, court judgments, etc. The beginner
will find for himself what methods he can use
best. Of course he must never let his discriminating
system become so elaborate that he consumes unjustifiable
time and thought in following its intricate
plan.</p>

<p>In all cases of quotations&mdash;either verbatim or in
resume&mdash;the authority must be noted. Author,
official title or position, title of work, circumstances,
date, volume, page, etc., should be clearly set down.
In law cases the date is especially important as so
frequently the latest decision reverses all the earlier
ones. For convenience of filing and handling these
items are placed at the top of the card.</p>

<p><br /><b>Using the Library</b>. A reader must know how to use
libraries. This means he must be able to find books
by means of the card catalogs. These are arranged
by both authors and subjects. If he knows the author
of a book or its title he can easily find the cards and
have the book handed to him. Very often he will
seek information upon topics entirely new to him.
In this case he must look under the entry of the topic
for all the books bearing upon his. From the titles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>the brief descriptions, and (sometimes) the tables of
contents upon the cards he can select intelligently the
books he needs. For instance, if he is searching for
arguments to support a new kind of city government
he could discard at once several books cataloged as
follows, while he could pick unerringly the four which
might furnish him the material he wants. These
books are listed under the general topic "Cities."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets. Old English
Towns. Municipal Administration. The Modern City and
its Problems. Personality of American Cities. Historic
Towns of the Southern States. Romantic Germany. Cities
of Italy. American Municipal Progress</i>.</p></div>

<p>Cross references are also valuable. In addition to
books cataloged under the topic consulted, others
grouped under other subjects may contain related
information. Here are three actual cross references
taken from a library catalog.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Land: Ownership, rights, and rent. See also conservation,
production, agriculture.</p>

<p>Laboring classes: Morals and habits. See also ethics,
amusements, Sunday.</p>

<p>Church. See also church and state, persecutions.</p></div>

<p>The continual use of a library will familiarize a
student with certain classes of books to which he may
turn for information. If he is permitted to handle
the books themselves upon the shelves he will soon
become skilful in using books. Many a trained
speaker can run his eye over titles, along tables of
contents, scan the pages, and unerringly pick the
heart out of a volume. Nearly all libraries now are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>arranged according to one general plan, so a visitor
who knows this scheme can easily find the class of
books he wants in almost any library he uses. This
arrangement is based upon the following decimal
numbering and grouping of subject matter.</p>

<p><b>Using Periodicals.</b> In the section on taking notes
the direction was given that in citing legal decisions
the latest should be secured. Why? That same
principle applies to citing any kind of information in
a speech. Science, history, politics, government, international
questions, change so rapidly in these times
that the fact of yesterday is the fiction of today, and
<i>vice versa.</i> A speaker must be up to date in his knowledge.
This he can be only by consulting current
periodicals. He cannot read them all so he must
use the aids provided for him. The best of these is
the <i>Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature</i> issued every
month and kept in the reference room of all libraries.
In it, arranged under both subject and author's name,
are listed the articles which have appeared in the
various magazines. The December issue contains
the entries for the entire year. A group of topics
from a recent monthly issue will show its value to
the speaker securing material.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Eastern Question. British case in the East. H. Sidebotham,
Asia 19:261-1263 Mr '19.&mdash;England and her
eastern policy. H. Sidebotham. Asia, 19:158-161. F '19.&mdash;Khanates
of the Middle East. Ikbal Ali Shah. Con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>temp.
115:183-187 F '19.&mdash;More secret treaties in the
Near East. L. Stoddard. Maps. World's Work. 37:
589-591. Mr '19.&mdash;Part of the United States in the Near
East. R of Rs 59:305-306 Mr '19.&mdash;Should America
act as trustee of the Near East? Asia, 19:141-144 F'19.</p></div>

<p>By this time the student speaker will have that
mental alertness referred to early in this book. He
will be reading regularly some magazine&mdash;not to pass
the time pleasantly&mdash;but to keep himself posted on
current topics and questions of general interest, in
which the articles will direct him to other periodicals
for fuller treatment of the material he is gathering.
The nature of some of these is suggested here.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Outlook</i>, "An illustrated weekly journal of current
events."</p>

<p><i>Current Opinion</i>, Monthly. Review of the World,
Persons in the Foreground, Music and Drama, Science and

The Industrial World, Reconstruction.</p>

<p><i>The Literary Digest</i>, Weekly. Topics of the Day, Foreign
Comment, Science and Invention, Letters and Art, Religion
and Social Service, Current Poetry, Miscellaneous, Investments
and Finance.</p>

<p><i>The Independent</i>, an illustrated weekly.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>PLANNING THE SPEECH</h3>


<p><b>Selecting Material</b>. It can be assumed, by the
time you have reached this point in the study and
practice of making speeches, that you have words to
express your thoughts and some fair skill of delivery,
that you know something about preparing various
kinds of introductions and conclusions, that you
know how your own mind operates in retaining new
information, and that you know how to secure material
for various purposes. Either clearly assimilated
in your brain or accurately noted upon paper you have
all the ideas that are to appear in your speech.</p>

<p><b>The Length of the Speech</b>. Look over this material
again. Consider it carefully in your thoughts,
mentally deciding how long a time or how many
words you will devote to each topic or entry. Can
you from such a practical consideration determine how
long in time your speech will be? Are you limited
by requirements to a short time as were the Four
Minute Speakers? Have you been allotted a half
hour? Will you hold your audience longer?</p>

<p>These may appear simple things, but they cover
the first essential of planning any speech. It should
be just the correct length&mdash;neither too long nor too
short. Many beginners&mdash;timid, hesitant, untrained&mdash;will
frequently fill too short a time, so that they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>must drill themselves into planning longer productions.
On the other hand, it may be stated, as a general
criticism, that many speakers talk too long.</p>

<p>A United States Senator, in order to block the vote
on a bill he was opposing, decided to speak until Congress
had to adjourn, so he deliberately planned to
cover a long time. He spoke for some twenty-two
hours. Of course he did not say much, nor did he
talk continuously; to get rests, he requested the clerk
to call the roll, and while the list was being marked,
he ate and drank enough to sustain him. Technically
his speech was uninterrupted, for he still had the
floor. Though we may not approve of such methods
of legislative procedure we must see that for this
speech the first element of its plan was its length.</p>

<p>Keep this consideration of time always in mind.
Speakers always ask how long they are to speak, or
they stipulate how much time they require. Legislative
bodies frequently have limiting rules. Courts
sometimes allow lawyers so much time. A minister
must fit his sermon to the length of the service. A
business man must not waste his hearers' time. A
lecturer must not tire his audience. In Congress
members must be given chances to eat. In Parliament,
which meets in the evening, men grow anxious
for bed.</p>

<p><b>Making the Speech too Long.</b> The rule is fundamental,
yet it is violated continually. I have known
of instances when four men, asked to present material
in a meeting announced months in advance as lasting
two hours, have totally disregarded this fact, and
prepared enough material to consume over an hour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>each. In such cases the presiding officer should state
to each that he will be allowed exactly thirty minutes
and no more. He may tap on the table after twenty-five
have elapsed to warn the speaker to pass to his
conclusion, and at the expiration of the time make
him bring his remarks to a close and give way to the
next speaker. There is no unfairness in this. The
real offense is committed by the speaker who proves
himself so inconsiderate, so discourteous of the
conditions that he places himself in such an embarrassing
circumstance. He deserves only justice tempered
by no mercy. I have heard the first of two speakers
who were to fill an hour of a commemorative service
in a church talk on for an hour and ten minutes, boring
the congregation to fidgety restlessness and completely
preventing the second speaker&mdash;the more important&mdash;from
delivering a single word.</p>

<p>Mark Twain tells how he went to church one hot
night to hear a city mission worker describe his
experiences among the poor people of the crowded
districts who, though they needed help, were too
modest or proud to ask for it. The speaker told of
the suffering and bravery he found. Then he pointed
out that the best gifts to charity are not the advertised
bounties of the wealthy but the small donations of the
less fortunate. His appeals worked Mark Twain up
to great enthusiasm and generosity. He was ready
to give all he had with him&mdash;four hundred dollars&mdash;and
borrow more. The entire congregation wanted
to offer all it had. But the missionary kept on talking.
The audience began to notice the heat. It became
hotter and hotter. They grew more and more un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>comfortable.
Mark's generosity began to shrink.
It dwindled to less and less as the speech lengthened
until when the plate did finally reach him, he stole
ten cents from it. He adds that this simply proves
how a little thing like a long-winded speech can induce
crime.</p>

<p>Plan your speech so that it will be the proper length.</p>

<p><b>Discarding Material</b>. This first consideration very
likely indicates to you that you have much more material
than you can use in the time allowed or assigned
you. You must discard some. Strange as it may
seem, this is one of the must difficult directions to carry
out. It seems such a waste of time and material to
select for actual presentation so small a part of all
you have carefully gathered. There is always the
temptation to "get it all in somehow." Yet the
direction must remain inflexible. You can use only
part of it. You must carefully select what will serve
your purpose. What is the purpose of your speech?
What is the character of your audience? These two
things will determine to a large extent, what and how
much you must relinquish. Your finished speech
will be all the better for the weeding-out process.
Better still, in all your preliminary steps for subsequent
speeches you will become skilful in selecting
while you are gathering the material itself. Finally
you will become so practised that you will not burden
yourself with waste, although you will always secure
enough to supply you with a reserve supply for assurance
and emergency.</p>

<p><b>Relation of Material to the Purpose of the Speech</b>.
A few examples will show the wide application of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>principle. A boy who has explained to his father
the scholarship rules of his school concerning athletes
will discard a great deal of that material when he addresses
a student gathering. A speaker on child
labor in a state where women have voted for a long
time will discard much of the material presented in a
neighboring state where general franchise has just
been granted. If in a series of remarks you want
to emphasize the thrilling experience you have had
with a large fish which jerked you out of a boat, you
would not include such material as the trip on the
train to the lake where you had your adventure. Why
not?</p>

<p>These are humble instances, but the principle of
selection is the same for all speeches.</p>

<p>A man who was asked to lecture on Mark Twain
knew the contents of the thirty published volumes
written by him, all the biographies, practically
every article written about him; he had conversed
with people who had known him; he had visited
scenes of his life; yet when he planned to talk for
an hour he had to reject everything except two
striking periods of his life with their effects upon
his writing.</p>

<p>Burke, in one great effort, declared he had no intention
of dealing with the <i>right</i> of taxation; he confined
himself merely to the <i>expediency</i> of Great Britain's
revenue laws for America. Other great speakers
have&mdash;in their finished speeches&mdash;just as clearly
indicated the plans they have decided to follow.
Such definite announcements determine the material
of many introductions.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>: <i>The Crime against Kansas</i>, 1856</p>

<p>Mr. President and Fellow Citizens of New York:</p>

<p>The facts with which I shall deal this evening are mainly
old and familiar; nor is there anything new in the general
use I shall make of them. If there shall be any novelty, it
will be in the mode of presenting the facts, and the inferences
and observations following that presentation. In his speech
last autumn at Columbus, Ohio, as reported in the <i>New
York Times</i>, Senator Douglas said: "Our fathers, when they
framed the government under which we live, understood this
question just as well, and even better, than we do now."</p>

<p>I fully indorse this, and I adopt it as a text for this discourse.
I so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an
agreed starting-point for a discussion between Republicans
and that wing of the Democracy headed by Senator Douglas.
It simply leaves the inquiry: What was the understanding
those fathers had of the question mentioned?</p>

<p><b>Indicating the Plan in the Speech</b>. In some finished
and long speeches parts of the plan are distributed to
mark the divisions in the progress of the development.
The next quotation shows such an insertion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And now sir, against all these theories and opinions, I
maintain&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the Constitution of the United States is not a
league, confederacy, or compact between the people of the
several States in their sovereign capacities; but a government
proper, founded on the adoption of the people, and
creating direct relations between itself and individuals.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That no State authority has power to dissolve these
relations; that nothing can dissolve them but revolution;
and that, consequently, there can be no such thing as secession
without revolution.</p>

<p>3. That there is a supreme law, consisting of the Constitution
of the United States, and acts of Congress passed in
pursuance of it, and treaties; and that, in cases not capable
of assuming the character of a suit in law or equity, Congress
must judge of, and finally interpret, this supreme law so
often as it has occasion to pass acts of legislation; and in
cases capable of assuming, and actually assuming, the character
of a suit, the Supreme Court of the United States is
the final interpreter.</p>

<p>4. That an attempt by a State to abrogate, annul, or
nullify an act of Congress, or to arrest its operation within
her limits, on the ground that, in her opinion, such law is
unconstitutional, is a direct usurpation on the just powers
of the general Government, and on the equal rights of other
States; a plain violation of the Constitution, a proceeding
essentially revolutionary in its character and tendency.</p>

<p>Such a statement to the audience is especially helpful
when the speaker is dealing with technical subjects,
or material with which most people are not usually
and widely conversant. Scientific considerations always
become clearer when such plans are simply constructed,
clearly announced, and plainly followed.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>So far as I know, there are only three hypotheses which
ever have been entertained, or which well can be entertained,
respecting the past history of Nature. I will, in the first
place, state the hypotheses, and then I will consider what
evidence bearing upon them is in our possession, and by
what light of criticism that evidence is to be interpreted.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Upon the first hypothesis, the assumption is, that phenomena
of Nature similar to those exhibited by the present
world have always existed; in other words, that the universe
has existed from all eternity in what may be broadly termed
its present condition.</p>

<p>The second hypothesis is, that the present state of things
has had only a limited duration; and that, at some period in
the past, a condition of the world, essentially similar to that
which we now know, came into existence, without any
precedent condition from which it could have naturally
proceeded. The assumption that successive states of
Nature have arisen, each without any relation of natural
causation to an antecedent state, is a mere modification of
this second hypothesis.</p>

<p>The third hypothesis also assumes that the present state
of things has had but a limited duration; but it supposes
that this state has been evolved by a natural process from
an antecedent state, and that from another, and so on; and,
on this hypothesis, the attempt to assign any limit to the
series of past changes is, usually, given up.</p>

<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. According to what methods are the foregoing plans
arranged? Which division in Sumner's speech was the most
important? Was he trying to get his listeners to do anything?
What do you think that object was?</p>

<p>2. In Lincoln's speech do you think he planned the
material chronologically? Historically? What reasons have
you for your answer?</p>

<p>3. Which of Webster's four parts is the most important?
Give reasons for your answer.</p>

<p>4. Which hypothesis (what does the word mean?) did
Huxley himself support? What induces you to think thus?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Is this plan in any respect like Sumner's? Explain your
answer.</p>

<p>5. Make a list of the ways in which material of speeches
may be arranged.</p>

<p><b>Arrangement. Importance.</b> If you have several
topics to cover in a single speech where would you
put the most important? First or last? Write upon
a piece of paper the position you choose. You have
given this plan some thought so you doubtlessly put
down the correct position. What did you write?
First? That is usually the answer of nine pupils out
of every ten. Are you with the majority? If you
wrote that the most important topic should be treated
first, you are wrong. The speech would be badly
planned. Think for a moment. Which should be
the most important part of a story or a play? The
beginning or the ending? If it is the early part, why
should any one read on to the end or stay for the
curtain to come down the last time? So in speeches
the importance of topics should always increase as the
speech proceeds. This, then, is a principle of planning.
Arrange your topics in an ascending order of
importance. Work up to what is called the climax.</p>

<p>The list you made in response to direction 5 given
above should now be presented to the class and its
contents discussed. What kind of material is likely
to be arranged according to each of your principles?
You have put down the chronological order, or the
order of time, or some similar phrase. Just what do
you mean by that? Do you mean, begin with the
earliest material and follow in chronological order
down to the latest? Could the reverse order ever be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>used? Can you cite some instance? Is contrast a
good order to follow in planning? Cite material
which could be so arranged. Would an arrangement
from cause to effect be somewhat like one based on
time? Explain your answer. Under what circumstances
do you think the opposite might be used&mdash;from
effect to cause?</p>

<p>While there are almost countless methods of arrangements&mdash;for
any one used in one part of a speech
may be combined with any other in some different
portion&mdash;the plan should always be determined by
three fundamental matters; the material itself, the
audience to which it is to be presented, and the effect
the speaker wants to produce.</p>

<p>Even during this preliminary planning of the speech
the author must be careful that when his arrangement
is decided upon it possesses the three qualities necessary
to every good composition. These three are
unity, coherence, and emphasis.</p>

<p><b>Unity.</b> Unity explains itself. A speech must be
about one single thing. A good speech produces one
result. It induces action upon one single point. It
allows no turning aside from its main theme. It does
not stray from the straight and narrow road to pick
flowers in the adjacent fields, no matter how enticing
the temptation to loiter may be. In plain terms it
does not admit as part of its material anything not
closely and plainly connected with it. It does not
step aside for everything that crops into the speaker's
mind. It advances steadily, even when not rapidly.
It does not "back water." It goes somewhere.</p>

<p>To preserve unity of impression a speaker must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>ruthlessly discard all material except that which is
closely associated with his central intention. He
must use only that which contributes to his purpose.
The same temptation to keep unrelated material&mdash;if
it be good in itself&mdash;will be felt now as when the
other unsuitable material was set aside.</p>

<p>This does not prevent variety and relief. Illustrative
and interesting minor sections may be, at times
must be, introduced. But even by their vividness
and attractiveness they must help the speech, not
hinder it. The decorations and ornaments must
never be allowed to detract from the utility of the
composition.</p>

<p>Unity may be damaged by admitting parts not in
the direct line of the theme. It may be violated by
letting minor portions become too long. The illustration
may grow so large by the introduction of
needless details that it makes the listeners forget the
point it was designed to enforce. Or it may be so
far-fetched as to bear no real relation to the thread
of development. Here lies the pitfall of the overworked
"funny," story, introduced by "that reminds
me." Too often it is not humorous enough to justify
repetition; or&mdash;what is worse&mdash;it does not fit into
the circumstances. Another fault of many speakers
is over-elaboration of expression, not only for non-essentials,
but in the important passages as well.
Involved language demands explanation. The attempts
to clear up what should have been simply
said at first may lead a speaker to devote too many
words to a single point.</p>

<p>This matter of unity must not be misunderstood as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>prohibiting the inclusion of more than one topic in
a speech. A legislator in urging the repeal of a law
might have several topics, such as how the law was
passed, its first operations, its increasing burdens
upon people, the disappearance of the necessity for
it, better methods of securing the same or better
results, etc., yet all grouped about the motivating
theme of securing the repeal of the law. To emphasize
the greatness of a man's career a speaker
might introduce such topics as his obscure origin, his
unmarked youth, the spur that stimulated his ambition,
his early reverses, provided that they contribute
to the impression intended, to make vivid his real
achievements.</p>

<p>In early attempts at delivering speeches don't be
afraid to pause at certain places to consider whether
what you are about to say really contributes to the
unity or destroys it. Aside from helping you to think
upon your feet, this mental exercise will help your
speech by making you pause at times&mdash;a feature of
speaking often entirely disregarded by many persons.</p>

<p><b>Coherence.</b> The second quality a finished composition
should have is coherence. If you know what
<i>cohere</i> and <i>cohesion</i> mean (perhaps you have met
these words in science study) you have the germ of
the term's meaning. It means "stick-together-itive-ness."
The parts of a speech should be so interrelated
that every part leads up to all that follows.
Likewise every part develops naturally from all that
goes before, as well as what immediately precedes.
There must be a continuity running straight through
the material from start to finish. Parts should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>placed where they fit best. Each portion should be
so placed&mdash;at least, in thought&mdash;that all before
leads naturally and consistently up to it, and it carries
on the thread to whatever follows. This prevents
rude breaks in the development of thought. Skilfully
done, it aids the hearer to remember, because so
easily did the thought in the speech move from one
point to another, that he can carry the line of its progression
with him long after. So the attainment of
coherence in a speech contributes directly to that
desired end&mdash;a deep impression.</p>

<p>Incoherent speeches are so mainly because of absence
of plan, whether they be short or long, conversational
or formal.</p>

<p><b>Emphasis.</b> The third quality a speech should have
is emphasis. Applied to a connected sequence of
words this means that what is of most importance
shall stand out most forcefully; that what is not so
important shall show its subordinate relation by its
position, its connection with what goes before and
after; that what is least important shall receive no
emphasis beyond its just due. Such manipulation
requires planning and rearranging, careful weighing
of the relative importance of all portions. Recall
what was said of the place of the most important
part.</p>

<p>Throughout the speech there must also be variety
of emphasis. It would not be fitting to have everything
with a forceful emphasis upon it. To secure
variation in emphasis you must remember that in
speeches the best effects will be made upon audiences
by offering them slight relief from too close attention
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>or too impressive effects. If you observe the plans
finally followed by good speakers you will be able to
see that they have obeyed this suggestion. They
have the power to do what is described as "swaying
the audience." In its simplest form this depends
upon varying the emphasis.</p>

<p>In making an appeal for funds for destitute portions
of Europe a telling topic would surely be the
sufferings of the needy. Would it be wise to dwell
upon such horrors only? Would a humorous anecdote
of the happy gratitude of a child for a cast-off toy be
good to produce emphasis? Which would make the
most emphatic ending&mdash;the absolute destitution,
the amount to be supplied, the relief afforded, or the
happiness to donors for sharing in such a worthy
charity? You can see how a mere mental planning,
or a shuffling of notes, or a temporary numbering of
topics will help in clearing up this problem of how to
secure proper and effective emphasis.</p>

<p><b>Making the First Plan.</b> It would be a helpful
thing at this point in the planning to make a pencil
list of the topics to be included. This is not a final
outline but a mere series of jottings to be changed,
discarded, and replaced as the author considers his
material and his speech. It is hardly more than an
informal list, a scrap of paper. In working with it,
don't be too careful of appearances. Erase, cross
out, interline, write in margins, draw lines and arrows
to carry portions from one place to another, crowd
in at one place, remove from another, cut the paper
sheets, paste in new parts, or pin slips together. Manipulate
your material. Mold it to suit your purposes.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Make it follow your plan. By this you will secure
a good plan. If this seems a great deal to do, compare
it with the time and energy required to learn
how to swim, how to play a musical instrument, how
to "shoot" in basketball, how to act a part in a play.</p>

<p>Knowing how to speak well is worth the effort.
Every time you plan a speech these steps will merge
into a continuous process while you are gathering the
material. In informal discussion upon topics you
are familiar with, you will become able to arrange
a plan while you are rising to your feet.</p>

<p><b>Transitions</b>. As this preliminary plan takes its
form under your careful consideration of the material
you will decide that there are places between topics
or sections which will require bridging over in order
to attain coherence and emphasis. These places of
division should be filled by transitions. A transition
is a passage which carries over the meaning from
what precedes to what follows. It serves as a connecting
link. It prevents the material from falling
apart. It preserves the continuity of ideas. A transition
may be as short as a single word, such as <i>however</i>,
<i>consequently</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>. It may be a sentence.
It may grow into a paragraph.</p>

<p>The purpose of transitions&mdash;to link parts together&mdash;may
induce beginners to consider them as of little
importance since they manifestly add no new ideas
to the theme. This opinion is entirely erroneous.
Even in material for reading, transitions are necessary.
In material to be received through the ear they are
the most valuable helps that can be supplied to have
the listener follow the development. They mark the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>divisions for him. They show that a certain section
is completed and a new one is about to begin. They
show the relation in meaning of two portions.</p>

<p>The shorter forms of transitions&mdash;words and
phrases&mdash;belong rather to the expression, the language,
of the speech than to this preliminary planning.</p>

<p>A speaker should never fail to use such phrases as
<i>on the other hand</i>, <i>continuing the same line of reasoning</i>,
<i>passing to the next point</i>, <i>from a different point of view</i>,
because they so clearly indicate the relation of two
succeeding passages of a speech.</p>

<p>In planning, the speaker frequently has to consider
the insertion of longer transitions&mdash;paragraphs or
even more extended passages. Just how such links
appear in finished speeches the following extracts
show. In the first selection Washington when he
planned his material realized he had reached a place
where he could conclude. He wanted to add more.
What reason should he offer his audience for violating
the principle discussed in the chapter on conclusions?
How could he make clear to them his desire to continue?
We cannot assert that he actually did this,
but he might have jotted down upon the paper bearing
a first scheme of his remarks the phrase, "my solicitude
for the people." That, then, was the germ of his
transition paragraph. Notice how clearly the meaning
is expressed. Could any hearer fail to comprehend?
The transition also announces plainly the topic of the
rest of the speech.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your
welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension
of danger, natural to that solicitude, urge me on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>an occasion like the present, to offer to your solemn contemplation,
and to recommend to your frequent review, some
sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no
inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all-important
to the permanency of your felicity as a people.
These will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you
can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting
friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias
his counsels. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it,
your indulgent reception of my sentiment on a former and
not dissimilar occasion.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">George Washington</span>: <i>Farewell Address</i>, 1796</p></div>

<p>The next selection answers to a part of the plan
announced in a passage already quoted in this chapter.
Notice how this transition looks both backward and
forward: it is both retrospective and anticipatory.
If you recall that repetition helps to emphasize facts,
you will readily understand why a transition is especially
valuable if it adheres to the same language
as the first statement of the plan. In a written scheme
this might have appeared under the entry, "pass
from 1 to 2; list 4 apologies for crime." This suggests
fully the material of the passage.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And with this exposure I take my leave of the Crime
against Kansas. Emerging from all the blackness of this
Crime, where we seem to have been lost, as in a savage wood,
and turning our backs upon it, as upon desolation and death,
from which, while others have suffered, we have escaped,
I come now to the Apologies which the Crime has found....</p>

<p>They are four in number, and fourfold in character. The
first is the Apology tyrannical; the second, the Apology imbecile;
the third, the Apology absurd; and the fourth, the
Apology infamous. That is all. Tyranny, imbecility, ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>surdity,
and infamy all unite to dance, like the weird sisters,
about this Crime.</p>

<p>The Apology tyrannical is founded on the mistaken act
of Governor Reeder, in authenticating the Usurping Legislature,
etc.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>: <i>The Crime against Kansas</i>, 1856</p></div>

<p>The beginning speaker should not hesitate to make
his transitions perfectly clear to his audience. When
they add to the merely bridging use the additional
value of serving as short summaries of what has gone
before and as sign posts of what is to follow, they are
trebly serviceable. The attempt to be clear will
seldom be waste of time or effort. The obvious statements
of the preceding selections, the use of figures,
are excellent models for speakers to imitate. With
practice will come skill in making transitions of different
kinds, in which the same purposes will be served
in various other ways, in what may be considered
more finished style. The next extracts represent
this kind of transition.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir, like most questions of civil prudence, this is neither
black nor white, but gray. The system of copyright has
great advantages and great disadvantages; and it is our
business to ascertain what these are, and then to make an
arrangement under which the advantages may be as far as
possible secured, and the disadvantages as far as possible
excluded. The charge which I bring against my honorable
and learned friend's bill is this, that it leaves the advantages
nearly what they are at present, and increases the disadvantages
at least fourfold.</p>

<p>One-third of the population of the South is of the Negro
race. No enterprise seeking the material, civil, or moral
welfare of this section can disregard this element of our
population and reach the highest success. I but convey to
you, Mr. President and Directors, the sentiment of the masses
of my race when I say that in no way have the value and
manhood of the American Negro been more fittingly and generously
recognized than by the managers of this magnificent
Exposition at every stage of its progress. It is a recognition
that will do more to cement the friendship of the two races
than any occurrence since the dawn of our freedom.</p>

<p><b>Thinking before You Speak.</b> While students may
feel that the steps outlined here demand a great deal
of preparation before the final speech is delivered,
the explanation may be given that after all, this careful
preparation merely carries out the homely adage&mdash;think
before you speak. If there were more thinking
there would be at once better speaking. Anybody can
talk. The purpose of studying is to make one a
better speaker. The anticipation of some relief may
be entertained, for it is comforting to know that after
one has followed the processes here explained, they
move more rapidly, so that after a time they may
become almost simultaneous up to the completion
of the one just discussed&mdash;planning the speech. It
is also worth knowing that none of this preliminary
work is actually lost. Nor is it unseen. It appears
in the speech itself. The reward for all its apparent
slowness and exacting deliberation is in the clearness,
the significance of the speech, its reception by the
audience, its effect upon them, and the knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>by the speaker himself that his efforts are producing
results in his accomplishments.</p>

<p>All speakers plan carefully for speeches long in
advance.</p>

<p>A famous alumnus of Yale was invited to attend
a banquet of Harvard graduates. Warned that he
must "speak for his dinner" he prepared more than
a dozen possible beginnings not knowing of course,
in what manner the toastmaster would call upon him.
The remainder of his speech was as carefully planned,
although not with so many possible choices. Note
that from each possible opening to the body of the
speech he had to evolve a graceful transition.</p>

<p>Edmund Burke, in his great speech on conciliation
with the American colonies, related that some time
before, a friend had urged him to speak upon this
matter, but he had hesitated. True, he had gone
so far as to throw "my thoughts into a sort of parliamentary
form"&mdash;that is, he made a plan or an
outline, but the passage of a certain bill by the House
of Commons seemed to have taken away forever the
chance of his using the material. The bill, however,
was returned from the House of Lords with an amendment
and in the resulting debate he delivered the
speech he had already planned.</p>

<p>Daniel Webster said that his reply to Hayne had
been lying in his desk for months already planned,
merely waiting the opportunity or need for its delivery.</p>

<p>Henry Ward Beecher, whose need for preliminary
preparation was reduced to its lowest terms, and who
himself was almost an instantaneous extemporizer,
recognized the need for careful planning by young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>speakers and warned them against "the temptation
to slovenliness in workmanship, to careless and inaccurate
statement, to repetition, to violation of good
taste."</p>

<p>Slovenliness in planning is as bad as slovenliness
in expression.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>MAKING THE OUTLINE OR BRIEF</h3>


<p><b>Orderly Arrangement.</b> A speech should have an
orderly arrangement. The effect upon an audience
will be more easily made, more deeply impressed, more
clearly retained, if the successive steps of the development
are so well marked, so plainly related, that they
may be carried away in a hearer's understanding. It
might be said that one test of a good speech is the
vividness with which its framework is discernible.
Hearers can repeat outlines of certain speeches. Those
are the best. Of others they can give merely confused
reports. These are the badly constructed ones.</p>

<p>The way to secure in the delivered speech this
delight of orderly arrangement is by making an outline
or brief. Most pupils hate to make outlines.
The reason for this repugnance is easily understood.
A teacher directs a pupil to make an outline before
he writes a composition or delivers a speech. The
pupil spends hours on the list of entries, then submits
his finished theme or address. He feels that the outline
is disregarded entirely. Sometimes he is not even
required to hand it to the instructor. He considers
the time he has spent upon the outline as wasted. It
is almost impossible to make him feel that his finished
product is all the better because of this effort spent
upon the preliminary skeleton, so that in reality his
outline is not disregarded at all, but is judged and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>marked as embodied in the finished article. Most
students carry this mistaken feeling about outlines
to such an extent that when required to hand in both
an outline and a finished composition they will write
in haphazard fashion the composition first, and then
from it try to prepare the outline, instead of doing as
they are told, and making the outline first. It is easier&mdash;though
not as educating or productive of good
results&mdash;to string words together than it is to do
what outline-making demands&mdash;to think.</p>

<p><b>Professional Writers' Use of Outlines.</b> Professional
writers realize the helpfulness of outline-making
and the time it saves. Many a magazine article has
been sold before a word of the finished manuscript
was written. The contributor submitted an outline
from which the editor contracted for the finished
production. Many a play has been placed in the
same form. Books are built up in the same manner.
The ubiquitous moving-picture scenario is seldom
produced in any other manner.</p>

<p>Macaulay advised a young friend who asked how
to keep his brain active to read a couple of solid books,
making careful outlines of their material at the same
time. One of these should be&mdash;if possible&mdash;a
work in a foreign tongue, so that the strangeness of
the language would necessitate slow, careful reading
and close thinking. All good students know that
the best way to prepare for an examination is to make
outlines of all the required reading and study.</p>

<p>It is just because the making of the outline demands
such careful thinking that it is one of the most important
steps in the production of a speech.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Outline in the Finished Speech.</b> If the outline
really shows in the finished speech, let us see if
we can pick the entries out from a portion of one.
Edmund Burke in 1775 tried to prevent Great Britain
from using coercive measures against the restive
American colonies. Many Englishmen were already
clamoring for war when Burke spoke in Parliament
upon conciliating the Colonies.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am sensible, Sir, that all which I have asserted in my
detail, is admitted in the gross; but that quite a different
conclusion is drawn from it. America, gentlemen say, is a
noble object. It is an object well worth fighting for. Certainly
it is, if fighting a people be the best way of gaining
them. Gentlemen in this respect will be led to their choice
of means by their complexions and their habits. Those who
understand the military art, will of course have some predilection
for it. Those who wield the thunder of the state,
may have more confidence in the efficacy of arms. But I
confess, possibly for want of this knowledge, my opinion is
much more in favor of prudent management, than of force;
considering force not as an odious, but a feeble instrument,
for preserving a people so numerous, so active, so growing,
so spirited as this, in a profitable and subordinate connexion
with us.</p>

<p>First, Sir, permit me to observe, that the use of force
alone is but <i>temporary</i>. It may subdue for a moment; but
it does not remove the necessity of subduing again; and a
nation is not governed which is perpetually to be conquered.</p>

<p>My next objection is its <i>uncertainty</i>. Terror is not always
the effect of force; and an armament is not a victory.
If you do not succeed, you are without resource; for, conciliation
failing, force remains; but, force failing, no further
hope of reconciliation is left. Power and authority are some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>times
bought by kindness; but they can never be begged as
alms by an impoverished and defeated violence.</p>

<p>A further objection to force is, that you <i>impair the object</i>
by your very endeavors to preserve it. The thing you
fought for is not the thing which you recover; but depreciated,
sunk, wasted, and consumed in the contest. Nothing
less will content me, than <i>whole America</i>. I do not choose
to consume its strength along with our own; because in all
parts it is the British strength that I consume. I do not
choose to be caught by a foreign enemy at the end of this
exhausting conflict, and still less in the midst of it. I may
escape; but I can make no assurance against such an event.
Let me add, that I do not choose wholly to break the
American spirit; because it is the spirit that has made the
country.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have no sort of <i>experience</i> in favor of force
as an instrument in the rule of our colonies. Their growth
and their utility has been owing to methods altogether different.
Our ancient indulgence has been said to be pursued
to a fault. It may be so. But we know if feeling is evidence
that our fault was more tolerable than our attempt
to mend it; and our sin far more salutary than our penitence.</p>

<p>These, Sir, are my reasons for not entertaining that
high opinion of untried force, by which many gentlemen,
for whose sentiments in other particulars I have great
respect, seem to be so greatly captivated. But there is still
behind a third consideration concerning this object, which
serves to determine my opinion on the sort of policy which
ought to be pursued in the management of America, even
more than its population and its commerce, I mean its
<i>temper and character</i>.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Edmund Burke</span>: <i>Conciliation with America</i>, 1775</p>
</div>

<p><b>Reconstructing the Outline.</b> In the preliminary
arrangement Burke knew that he was going to give
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>his reasons against the use of military force. In his
first plan he may not have decided just where he was
going to place his four arguments. So they very likely
appeared as four topic entries:</p>

<p>
Against use of force.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1. temporary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2. uncertain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">3. damages America</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">4. no experience</span><br />
</p>

<p>Notice that these are jottings to suggest the germs
of the arguments. When Burke revised this section
he may have changed the expression to indicate more
certainty.</p>

<p>
Force should not be used against the colonies, because:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1. it is only temporary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2. it is uncertain in its results</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">3. it would damage the wealth of the colonies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">4. it is based on no experience of Great Britain with</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">colonies</span><br />
</p>

<p>Of course, a practised statesman would not have to
analyze farther, perhaps not so far, but to illustrate
for a student how he might build up his outline, let
us analyze one degree farther. Just what is meant
by such terms as <i>temporary, uncertain?</i> Under each
statement, then, might be added a detailed explanation.
The finished part of the outline would then
appear somewhat like this.</p>

<p>
Force should not be used against the colonies, because:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1. it is only temporary, for</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>a.</i> though it subdue for a time, it would have to</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">be used again.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2. it is uncertain in its results, for</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>a.</i> Great Britain might not subdue the colonies.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">3. it would damage the wealth of the colonies, for</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>a.</i> we would fight to retain a wealthy land, yet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">after the war we should have a ruined one.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">4. it is based on no experience of Great Britain with</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">colonies, for</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;"><i>a.</i> Great Britain has always been indulgent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">rather than severely strict.</span>
</p>

<p>Speaking or writing from such a detailed outline
as this, consider how much thinking has already been
done. With these entries under his eye the speaker
need think only of the phrasing of his remarks. He
would feel perfectly certain that he would not wander
from his theme. Notice how the ideas can be emphasized.
The suggestion of damage can be expressed
in <i>impair the object</i>, and in <i>depreciated, sunk, wasted,
consumed</i>.</p>

<p>So far this outline&mdash;though it covers all its own
material&mdash;does not indicate the place at which it
shall be used in the speech. It could be used near
the conclusion where Burke planned to answer all the
supporters of plans other than his own. That would
be a good place for it. But Burke found a better one.
He separated this from his other remarks against his
opponents, and brought it in much earlier, thereby
linking it with what it most concerned, emphasizing it,
and disposing of it entirely so far as his speech was
concerned. He had just enumerated the wealth of
the colonies as represented by their commerce. He
knew that the war party would argue, "If America is
so wealthy, it is worth fighting for." That was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>place, then, to refute them. To introduce his material
he had to make clear the transition from the
colonial wealth to his arguments. Notice how plainly
the first paragraph quoted here does this. Having
given his four reasons against the use of force, notice
that he must bring his audience back to the theme
he has been discussing. The last paragraph does
this in a masterly manner. He has cited two facts
about the colonies. To make understanding doubly
certain he repeats them&mdash;population and commerce&mdash;and
passes to the next, plainly numbering it as the
third.</p>

<p>This recital of the process is not an account of what
actually took place in Burke's preparation, but it will
give to the student the method by which great speakers
<i>may</i> have proceeded; we do know that many did
follow such a scheme. No amateur who wants to
make his speeches worth listening to should omit this
helpful step of outline or brief making. Whether he
first writes out his speeches in full, or composes them
upon his feet, every speaker should prepare an outline
or brief of his material. This is a series of entries,
so condensed and arranged as to show the relative
significance of all the parts of the speech in the proper
order of development.</p>

<p><b>Outline, Brief, Legal Brief.</b> An outline contains
entries which are merely topics, not completed statements
or sentences.</p>

<p>A brief contains completed statements (sentences).</p>

<p>A legal brief is a formally prepared document (often
printed) submitted to a certain court before a case is
tried, showing the material the lawyer intends to pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>duce,
citing all his authorities, suggesting interpretations
of laws and legal decisions to support his contentions,
and giving all his conclusions. It is prepared
for the use of the court, to reduce the labor in examining
records, etc. Practice in the drawing up of such
briefs is an important phase of legal study.</p>

<p><b>The Outline.</b> An outline may recall to a person's
mind what he already has learned, but it is seldom
definite and informative enough to be as helpful as a
brief. A good distinction of the two&mdash;besides the
one respecting the forms already given&mdash;is that the
outline represents the point of view of the speaker
while the brief represents that of the hearer. Consider
again the analyses of Burke in this chapter.
Notice that the first list does not give nearly so clear
an idea of what Burke actually said as the third. A
person seeing only the first might <i>guess</i> at what the
speaker intended to declare. A person who looked
at the third could not fail to <i>know exactly</i> the opinions
of the speaker and the arguments supporting them.</p>

<p>Pupils frequently make this kind of entry:</p>

<p>
Introduction&mdash;Time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Characters</span><br />
</p>

<p>The main objections to such an outline are that it
tells nothing definite, and that it might fit a thousand
compositions. Even an outline should say more than
such a list does.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>In one edition of Burke's speech the page from which
the following is quoted is headed "Brief." Is it a
brief?</p>

<p>

<p><b>The Brief.</b> One of the shortest briefs on record
was prepared by Abraham Lincoln for use in a suit
to recover $200 for the widow of a Revolutionary
veteran from an agent who had retained it out of
$400 pension money belonging to her. It formed the
basis of his speech in court.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</p>

<p><i>Resolved:</i> That capital punishment should be abolished.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>Brief for the Affirmative</i></p>

<p>
I. Capital punishment is inexpedient.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>a</i>) It is contrary to the tendency of civilization.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>b</i>) It fails to protect society.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) It does not prevent murder.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) New crimes follow hard on executions.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>c</i>) It makes punishment uncertain.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) Many criminals are acquitted who would</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">be convicted if the penalty were imprisonment.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>d</i>) It is not reformatory.</span><br />
<br />
II. Capital punishment is immoral.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>a</i>) It rests on the old idea of retribution.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>b</i>) It tends to weaken the sacredness of human life.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>c</i>) It endangers the lives of innocent people.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>d</i>) Executions and the sensational newspaper</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">accounts which follow have a corrupting influence.</span><br />
<br />
III. Capital punishment is unjust.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>a</i>) Its mistakes are irremediable.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>b</i>) Many men are criminals from force of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">circumstances.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) From heredity.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) From environment.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>c</i>) Inequalities in administration are marked.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) In some states men are hung, in others</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">imprisoned for the same crime.</span><br />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) Many jurors have conscientious scruples</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">against condemning a man to death.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(3) Men of wealth and influence are rarely</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">convicted.</span><br />
<br />
IV. The abolition of capital punishment has been followed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">by satisfactory results,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>a</i>) In Europe.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) Russia.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) Switzerland.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(3) Portugal.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(4) Belgium.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(5) Holland.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>b</i>) In the United States.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) Michigan.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) Rhode Island.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(3) Maine.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(4) Wisconsin.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Brief for the Negative</i><br />
<br />
I. Capital punishment is permissible.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>a</i>) It has the sanction of the Bible.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) Genesis ix, 2-6.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>b</i>) It has the sanction of history.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) It has been in vogue since the beginning</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of the world.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>c</i>) It has the sanction of reason.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) The most fitting punishment is one equal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">and similar to the injury inflicted.</span><br />
<br />
II. Capital punishment is expedient.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>a</i>) It is necessary to protect society from anarchy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">and private revenge.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) Death is the strongest preventative of</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">crime.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>b</i>) No sufficient substitute has been offered.</span><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) Life imprisonment is a failure.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) Few serve the sentence.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>c</i>) Its abolition has not been successful.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) In Rhode Island.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) In Michigan.</span><br />
<br />
III. The objections made to capital punishment are not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">sound.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>a</i>) Prisons are not reformatory.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>b</i>) The fact that crimes have decreased in some</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">places where executions have stopped is</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">not a valid argument.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) All causes which increase the moral well-being</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">of the race decrease crime.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>c</i>) The objection that the innocent suffer is not</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">strong.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) The number of innocent thus suffering is</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">inconsiderable when compared with the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">great number of murders prevented.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(<i>d</i>) The objection that the penalty is uncertain may</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">be overcome by making it certain.</span><br />

<p>A few paragraphs back it was said that an outline
or brief shows the relative significance of all the parts
of a speech. This is done by a systematic use of
margins and symbols. From the quoted forms in
this chapter certain rules can easily be deduced.</p>

<p><b>Margins.</b> The speech will naturally divide into a
few main parts. These can be designated by spaces
and general titles such as introduction, body, development,
main argument, answer to opposing views,
conclusion. Other captions will be suggested by
various kinds of material. Main topics next in importance
are placed the farthest to the left, making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>the first margin. A reader can run his eye down this
line and pick out all the main topics of equal importance.
Entries just subordinate to these are put each on a
separate line, starting slightly to the right. This separation
according to connection and value is continued as
long as the maker has any minor parts to represent in
the brief. It should not be carried too far, however,
for the purpose of the entries is to mark clearness and
accuracy. If the helping system becomes too elaborate
and complicated it destroys its own usefulness.</p>

<p>It is perfectly plain that such an outline might be
made and be quite clear, without the addition of any
symbols at all, especially if it was short.</p>

<p>Discrimination in the use of words is secured by</p>

<p>
The study of synonyms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">antonyms</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">homonyms</span><br />
and care in employing them.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Symbols.</b> Some scheme of marking the entries is
a great help. There is no fixed system. Every
student may choose from among the many used. If
there are many main topics it might be a mistake to
use Roman numerals (I, XVIII) as few people can
read them quickly enough to follow their sequence.
Capital letters may serve better to mark the sequences,
but they do not indicate the numerical position. For
instance, most of us do not know our alphabets well
enough to translate a main topic marked N into the
fourteenth point. By combinations of Roman numerals,
capitals, usual (Arabic) numerals, small letters,
parentheses, enough variety to serve any student
purpose can easily be arranged.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Tabulations.</b> With unusual kinds of material and
for special purposes there may be value in evolving
other forms of outlines. A technically trained person
accustomed to reading tabulated reports with hosts
of figures to interpret might find a statistical statement
at times better suited to his needs. Such tabulations
are not any easier to prepare than the regular
brief. In fact to most people they are infinitely more
difficult to get into form and almost beyond speedy
comprehension afterwards. The following is a good
illustration of a simple one well adapted to the speaker's
purpose&mdash;a report of the objections to the first published
covenant of the League of Nations. He knew
the material of his introduction and conclusion so
well that he did not represent them in his carefully
arranged sheet. The form was submitted as regular

<p><b>Authorities in the Brief.</b> Authorities for the statements
made in the brief may be put into parentheses,
if they are to be included. Such further devices will
suggest themselves to students. In addition to such
markings as here listed, some men who use many
outlines emphasize upon them details which they may
have to find quickly by underlining the symbol or
first word with colored pencil. Such a device is especially
valuable to a technical expert whose system
could be uniform through the outlines of all his reports,
etc. Or a lecturer with so much time to fill may mark
upon the outline 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, to indicate to himself
that his material is being covered at a proper rate
to correspond with the time. He might put in <i>15
min.</i> or <i>30 min.</i> or <i>45 min.</i> if he was to speak for an
hour. The first division is the better, for he might
be required to condense a twenty-minute speech
to ten.</p>

<p><b>Selections for Briefing.</b> Before the student makes
many briefs of his own he should work in the other
direction by outlining material already in existence
so that he can be assured he knows main topics from
minor ones, important issues from subordinate reasons,
headings from examples. If all the members of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>class outline the same material the resulting discussion
will provide additional exercise in speaking in explanation
or support of an interpretation. After the teacher
and class together have made one, the students should
work independently.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>Besides the extracts quoted here others should be supplied.
Editorials from a single issue of a newspaper can easily be
secured by the entire class for this work. A chapter from a
book may be assigned.</p>

<p class="center">1. INCIDENTS OF GOVERNMENT TRADING</p>

<p>An expert before the President's street railway commission
of inquiry testified that he disapproved of public
ownership and operation theoretically, but approved it
practically, because it was the quickest and surest way of
making people sick of it. Otherwise he thought that education
of the public out of its favor for high costs and low
profits by public utilities would require a generation, and
the present emergency calls for prompt relief.</p>

<p>New York City has just resolved to build with its own
funds a Coney Island bathhouse, and has on file an offer
to build it with private money at a cost of $300,000, with a
guarantee of 15-cent baths. Accepting no responsibility
for the merits of the private bidder's proposal, it does not
appear likely that the city can supply cheaper baths or give
more satisfaction to bathers than a management whose
profits were related to its efforts to please patrons. On the
other hand, it is sure that the city's financial embarrassment
is due to supplying many privileges at the cost of the taxpayers,
which might have been supplied both more cheaply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>and better by private enterprise with profit than by the city
without profit, and with the use of ill-spared public funds.</p>

<p>New York does not stand alone in these misadventures,
which are warnings against trading by either local or national
government. Take, for example, the manner in
which the army is disposing of its surplus blankets, as
reported from Boston. A Chicago firm which wished to
bid was permitted to inspect three samples of varying grades,
but a guarantee that the goods sold would correspond to
the samples was refused. The bales could neither be opened
nor allowed to be opened, nor would information be given
whether the blankets in the bales were cotton, wool, or
mixed, whether single or double, whether bed blankets or
regulation army blankets. The likelihood that the Government
will get the worth of its blankets is small. There may
be unknown reasons for such uncommercial procedure, but
what shall be said of the fact that at the same time that
these blankets are being sold the Interior Department is
asking for bids to supply 10,000 blankets for the Indians?
The reason for buying more when there is an embarrassing
over-supply is that the specifications call for the words
"Interior Department" to be woven into the blankets.
To an outsider it would seem that the words might be
indelibly stamped on the old blankets of similar description,
and that the departure from custom would be better than
the loss on the old blankets and the increased expenditure
for the new blankets.</p>

<p>The reason for mentioning such incidents is that there
are so many more of which the public never hears. Their
combined educative effect would be great, but it is wasted
without publicity. Since the public is not unanimous
against public ownership and operation, there must be a
considerable number of persons who are proof against anything
but a catastrophe greater than the prostration of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>the railway and utility industries. That is an expansive
way of education, but perhaps Dr. Cooley, Dean of the
University of Michigan, is right in his view that the method
is necessary to prevent a greater calamity by persistence
in the error.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><i>New York Times</i>, July 21, 1919</p>

<p>2. Fourscore and seven years ago our Fathers brought
forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
equal.</p>

<p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing
whether that nation or any nation so conceived or so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield
of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting place for those who here gave their
lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting
and proper that we should do this.</p>

<p>But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate&mdash;we cannot
consecrate&mdash;we cannot hallow this ground. The
brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated
it far above our poor power to add or detract.
The world will little note nor long remember what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for
us, the living, rather, to be here dedicated to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
great task remaining before us&mdash;that from these honored
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which
they gave the last full measure of devotion; that we here
highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain;
that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom;
and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>3. Every thoughtful and unprejudiced mind must see
that such an evil as slavery will yield only to the most radical
treatment. If you consider the work we have to do, you
will not think us needlessly aggressive, or that we dig down
unnecessarily deep in laying the foundations of our enterprise.
A money power of two thousand millions of dollars,
as the prices of slaves now range, held by a small body of
able and desperate men; that body raised into a political
aristocracy by special constitutional provisions; cotton, the
product of slave labor, forming the basis of our whole foreign
commerce, and the commercial class thus subsidized; the
press bought up, the pulpit reduced to vassalage, the heart
of the common people chilled by a bitter prejudice against
the black race; our leading men bribed, by ambition, either
to silence or open hostility;&mdash;in such a land, on what shall
an Abolitionist rely? On a few cold prayers, mere lip-service,
and never from the heart? On a church resolution,
hidden often in its records, and meant only as a decent
cover for servility in daily practice? On political parties,
with their superficial influence at best, and seeking ordinarily
only to use existing prejudices to the best advantage?
Slavery has deeper root here than any aristocratic institution
has in Europe; and politics is but the common pulse-beat,
of which revolution is the fever-spasm. Yet we have
seen European aristocracy survive storms which seemed to
reach down to the primal strata of European life. Shall we,
then, trust to mere politics, where even revolution has
failed? How shall the stream rise above its fountain?
Where shall our church organizations or parties get strength
to attack their great parent and moulder, the slave power?
Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hastthou made me thus? The old jest of one who tried to lift
himself in his own basket, is but a tame picture of the man
who imagines that, by working solely through existing sects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>and parties, he can destroy slavery. Mechanics say nothing,
but an earthquake strong enough to move all Egypt can
bring down the pyramids.</p>

<p>Experience has confirmed these views. The Abolitionists
who have acted on them have a "short method"
with all unbelievers. They have but to point to their own
success, in contrast with every other man's failure. To
waken the nation to its real state, and chain it to the consideration
of this one duty, is half the work. So much have
we done. Slavery has been made the question of this generation.
To startle the South to madness, so that every
step she takes, in her blindness, is one step more toward
ruin, is much. This we have done. Witness Texas and
the Fugitive Slave Law.</p>

<p>4. Until just a few years ago flying was popularly
regarded as a dangerous hobby and comparatively few had
faith in its practical purposes. But the phenomenal evolutions
of the aircraft industry during the war brought progress
which would otherwise have required a span of years. With
the cessation of hostilities considerable attention has been
diverted to the commercial uses of aircraft, which may conveniently
be classified as mail-and passenger-service.</p>

<p>Men who first ventured the prediction that postal
and express matter would one day be carried through the
air were branded as dreamers. Parts of that dream became
a reality during 1918, and a more extensive aerial-mail
program will be adopted this year. The dispatch with
which important communications and parcels are delivered
between large cities has firmly established its need.</p>

<p>Large passenger-carrying aircraft are now receiving
pronounced attention. Lately developed by the Navy
is a flying-boat having a wing area of 2,400 square feet,
equipped with three Liberty motors and weighing 22,000
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>pounds with a full load. It is the largest seaplane in the
world, and on a recent test-trip from Virginia to New York
carried fifty-one passengers. At the present moment the
public is awaiting the thrilling details of the first flight
between Europe and America, which has just occurred as
a result of the keen international rivalry involved between
the various entrants.</p>

<p>The British are now constructing a super-triplane fitted
with six 500 horse-power engines. Originally intended
to carry 10,000 pounds of bombs and a crew of eight
over a distance of 1,200 miles, the converted machine is
claimed to be able to carry approximately one hundred
passengers. It has a wing span of 141 feet and a fuselage
length of 85 feet.</p>

<p>What about the power plants of the future aircraft?
Will the internal-combustion engine continue to reign
supreme, or will increasing power demands of the huge
planes to come lead to the development of suitable steam-engines?
Will the use of petroleum continue to be one of
the triumphs of aviation, or will the time come when substitutes
may be successfully utilized?</p>

<p>For aerial motive-power, the principal requirements
are: great power for weight with a fairly high factor of
safety, compactness, reliability of operation under flying
conditions, and safety from fire. Bulk and weight of steam-driven
equipment apparently impose severe restrictions
upon its practical development for present aircraft purposes,
but who is willing to classify its future use as an absurdity?</p>

<p>Steam operation in small model airplanes is no innovation.
Langley, in 1891-1895, built four model airplanes,
one driven by carbonic-acid gas and three by steam-engines.
One of the steam-driven models weighed thirty
pounds, and on one occasion flew a distance of about three
thousand feet. In 1913 an Englishman constructed a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>power plant weighing about two pounds which consisted of
a flash boiler and single-acting engine. This unit employed
benzolin, impure benzine, as fuel, and propelled a model
plane weighing five pounds.</p>

<p><b>Making a Brief.</b> The next step after making outlines
or briefs of material already organized is to make
your own from material you gather. Speeches you
have already prepared or considered as fit for presentation
will supply you with ideas if you cannot work up
new material in a short time. At first you will be
more concerned with the form than the meaning of the
entries, but even from the first you should consider
the facts or opinions for which each topic or statement
stands. Weigh its importance in the general scheme
of details. Consider carefully its suitability for the
audience who may be supposed to hear the finished
speech. Discard the inappropriate. Replace the
weak. Improve the indefinite. Be sure your examples
and illustrations are apt.</p>

<p>Be wary about statistics. In listening to an address
many people begin to distrust as soon as figures are
mentioned. Statistics will illustrate and prove assertions,
but they must be used judiciously. Do not
use too many statistics. Never be too detailed. In
a speech, $4,000,000 sounds more impressive than
$4,232,196.96. Use round numbers. Never let them
stand alone. Show their relationship. Burke quotes
exact amounts to show the growth of the commerce of
Pennsylvania, but he adds that it had increased fifty
fold. A hearer will forget the numbers; he will
remember the fact.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar reasons will warn you concerning the use
of too many dates. They can be easily avoided by
showing lapses of time&mdash;by saying, "fifty years
later," or "when he was forty-six years old," or "this
condition was endured only a score of months."</p>

<p>The chapters on introductions, conclusions, and
planning material will have suggested certain orders
for your briefs. Glance back at them for hints before
you attempt to make the general scheme. Let two
factors determine your resultant development&mdash;the
nature of the material itself and the effect you want
to produce.</p>

<p>In argumentative speeches a usual, as well as excellent,
order is this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em; ">
1. Origin of the question. The immediate cause for discussion.<br />
<br />
2. History of the question.<br />
<br />
3. Definition of terms.<br />
<br />
4. Main arguments.<br />
<br />
5. Conclusion.<br />
</p>

<p>Why is the proposition worth discussing at this present
time? Why do you choose it? Why is it timely?
What is its importance? Why is a settlement needed?
Any of these would fall under the first heading.</p>

<p>Has the matter engaged attention prior to the
present? Has it changed? Was any settlement ever
attempted? What was its result?</p>

<p>Are any of the words and phrases used likely to be
misunderstood? Are any used in special senses?
Do all people accept the same meaning? Good illustrations
of this last are the ideas attached to <i>socialism</i>,
<i>anarchist</i>, <i>soviet</i>, <i>union</i>.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>To illustrate: the question of woman suffrage was
brought into public interest once more by the advance
woman has made in all walks of life and by the needs
and lessons of the great war. To make clear how its
importance had increased a speaker might trace its
history from its first inception. As applied to women,
what does "suffrage" mean exactly&mdash;the right to
vote in all elections, or only in certain ones? Does it
carry with it the right to hold office? Would the
voting qualifications be the same for women as for
men? Then would follow the arguments.</p>

<p>How could this scheme be used for a discussion of
the Monroe Doctrine? For higher education? For
education for girls? For child working laws? For
a league of nations? For admitting Asiatic laborers
to the United States? For advocating the study of
the sciences? For urging men to become farmers?
For predicting aerial passenger service? For a scholarship
qualification in athletics? For abolishing railroad
grade crossings? For equal wages for men and
women?</p>

<p><b>Speaking from the Brief.</b> Now that the brief is
finished so that it represents exactly the material and
development of the final speech, how shall it be used?
To use it as the basis of a written article to be memorized
is one method. Many speakers have employed
such a method, many today do. The drawbacks of
such memorizing have already been hinted at in an
early chapter. If you want to grow in mental grasp,
alertness, and power as a result of your speech training
avoid this method. No matter how halting your
first attempts may be, do not get into the seemingly
easy, yet retarding habit of committing to memory.
Memorizing has a decided value, but for speech-making
the memory should be trained for larger matters than
verbal reproduction. It should be used for the
retention of facts while the other brain faculties are
engaged in manipulating them for the best effect and
finding words to express them forcefully. Memory is
a helpful faculty. It should be cultivated in connection
with the powers of understanding and expression,
but it is not economical to commit a speech verbatim
for delivery. The remarks will lack flexibility, spontaneity,
and often direct appeal. There is a detached,
mechanical air about a memorized speech which helps
to ruin it.</p>

<p>With the outline before you, go over it carefully and
slowly, mentally putting into words and sentences the
entries you have inserted. You may even speak it
half aloud to yourself, if that fixes the treatment more
firmly in your mind. Then place the brief where you
can reach it with your eye, and speak upon your feet.
Some teachers recommend doing this before a mirror,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>but this is not always any help, unless you are conscious
of awkward poses or gestures or movements, or facial
contortions. Say the speech over thus, not only once
but several times, improving the phraseology each
time, changing where convenient or necessary, the
emphasis, the amount of time, for each portion.</p>

<p><b>Self-criticism.</b> Try to criticize yourself. This is
not easy at first, but if you are consistent and persistent
in your efforts you will be able to judge yourself
in many respects. If you can induce some friend
whose opinion is worth receiving either to listen to
your delivery or to talk the whole thing over with you,
you will gain much. In conference with the teacher
before your delivery of the speech such help will be
given. As you work over your brief in this manner
you will be delighted to discover suddenly that you
need refer to it less and less frequently. Finally, the
outline will be in your mind, and when you speak you
can give your entire attention to the delivery and the
audience.</p>

<p>Do not be discouraged if you cannot retain all the
outline the first times you try this method. Many a
speaker has announced in his introduction, "I shall
present four reasons," and often has sat down after
discussing only three. Until you can dispense entirely
with the brief keep it near you. Speak from it if you
need it. Portions which you want to quote exactly
(such as quotations from authorities) may be memorized
or read. In reading be sure you read remarkably
well. Few people can read interestingly before
a large audience. Keep your papers where you can
get at them easily. Be careful not to lose your place
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>so that you will have to shuffle them to get the cue
for continuing. Pauses are not dangerous when they
are made deliberately for effect, but they are ruinous
when they betray to the audience forgetfulness or
embarrassment on the part of the speaker. Anticipate
your need. Get your help before you actually need
it, so that you can continue gracefully.</p>

<p><b>Results.</b> This method, followed for a few months,
will develop speaking ability. It produces results
suited to modern conditions of all kinds of life. It
develops practically all the mental faculties and personal
attributes. It puts the speaker directly in
touch with his audience. It permits him to adapt his
material to an occasion and audience. It gives him
the opportunity to sway his hearers and used legitimately
for worthy ends, this is the most worthy purpose
of any speech.</p>

<h3>EXPLAINING</h3>


<p>The part which explanation plays in all phases of
life is too apparent to need any emphasis here. It is
to a great extent the basis of all our daily intercourse,
from explaining to a teacher why a lesson has not been
prepared, to painstakingly explaining to a merchant
why a bill has not been paid. An instructor patiently
explains a problem to a class, and a merchant explains
the merits of an article or the operation of a device to
his customers. The politician explains why he should
be elected. The financier explains the returns from
stock and bond purchases. The President explains
to the Senate the reason for treaty clauses. The
minister explains the teachings of his faith to his
congregation. You can make this list as long as the
varied activities of all life.</p>

<p><b>Exposition.</b> This kind of discourse, the purpose of
which is explanation, is also called exposition. Has
it any relation to the underlying idea of the term
<i>exposition</i> as applied to a great exhibition or fair?
Its purpose is plainly information, the transmission
of knowledge. While description and narration exist
primarily to entertain, exposition exists to convey
information. Description and narration may be classed
as literature of entertainment; exposition as literature
of knowledge. It answers such questions as how?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>why? for what purpose? in what manner? by what
method? It can sometimes be used to convince a
person with opposing views, for frequently you hear
a man to whom the explanation of a belief has been
made, exclaim, "Oh, if that's what you mean, I agree
with you entirely." All instruction, all directions of
work, all scientific literature, are in foundation expository.
In its simplest, most disconnected form,
exposition gives its value to that most essential volume,
the dictionary.</p>

<p>Make a list of other kinds of books which are mainly
or entirely expository in character.</p>

<p><b>Difficulties in Exposition.</b> Such are the purpose
and use of exposition. The difficulty of producing
good exposition is evident from those two factors.
As it, exists everywhere, as it purposes to inform, its
first requisite is clearness. Without that quality it
is as nothing. When you direct a stranger how to
reach a certain building in your town, of what value are
your remarks unless they are clear? When a scientist
writes a treatise on the topic of the immortality of
man, of what value are his opinions unless his statements
are clear? All the other qualities which prose
may and should possess sink into subordinate value
in exposition when compared with clearness. Because
of all three phases of exposition&mdash;its universal use,
its informative purpose, its essential clarity&mdash;exposition
is an all-important topic for the consideration
and practice of the public speaker. In its demand for
clearness lies also its difficulty. Is it easy to tell the
exact truth, not as a moral exercise, but merely as a
matter of exactness? Why do the careless talkers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>speak so often of "a sort of pink" or "a kind of
revolving shaft" or tack on at the end of phrases the
meaningless "something" or "everything" except
that even in their unthinking minds there is the hazy
impression&mdash;they really never have a well-defined
idea&mdash;that they have not said exactly what they
want to say?</p>

<p><b>Clear Understanding.</b> Here then is the first requisite
for the public speaker. He must have no hazy impressions,
no unthinking mind, no ill-defined ideas,
no inexactness. He must have a clear understanding
of all he tries to tell to others. Without this the words
of a speaker are as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals.
Or he may deliver a great roar of words signifying
nothing. This is the fault with most recitations of
pupils in school&mdash;they do not get a clear understanding
of the material assigned to them for mastery. As
a test of the degree of understanding, the recitation
method serves admirably. The lecture method of
instruction&mdash;clear though the presentation may be&mdash;offers
no manner of finding out, until the final examination,
how much the pupil actually understands. So
far, in public speaking, the only way of learning that
the student understands the principles and can apply
them is to have him speak frequently to indicate his
ability. Can you not name among your associates
and friends those whose explanations are lucid, concise,
direct, unconfusing, and others whose attempts
at exposition are jumbled, verbose, unenlightening?</p>

<p>Have you not criticized certain teachers by remarking
"they may know their own subjects all right, but they
couldn't impart their knowledge to the class"?</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Command of Language.</b> What was lacking in
their case? Certainly, to be charitable, we cannot
say they lacked a clear understanding of their own
topic. It must have been something else. That
second element, which is at times almost entirely
absent when the first is present, is the command of
language. Many a man knows a great deal but is
incapable of transmitting his knowledge. He lacks
the gift of expression. He has not cultivated it&mdash;for
it can be cultivated. The man whose desire or
vocation forces him to make the effort to speak will
train himself in methods of communication, until he
arrives at comfort and fluency.</p>

<p>The district manager of a large electric company
related that as he would sit at a meeting of the directors
or committee of a large corporation and realized
that the moment was approaching when he would be
called upon to speak he would feel his senses grow
confused, a sinking feeling amounting almost to faintness
would sweep over him. Strong in his determination
to do the best he could for his company he would
steady his nerves by saying to himself, "You know
more about this matter than any of these men. That's
why you are here. Tell them what you know so
plainly that they will understand as well as you do."
There was, you see, the reassurance of complete understanding
of the subject coupled with the endeavor to
express it clearly. These two elements, then, are of
supreme significance to the public speaker. Even to
the person who desires to write well, they are all-important.
To the speaker they are omnipresent.
The effect of these two upon the intellectual develop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>ment
is marked. The desire for clear understanding
will keep the mind stored with material to assimilate
and communicate. It will induce the mind continually
to manipulate this material to secure clarity in
presentation. This will result in developing a mental
adroitness of inestimable value to the speaker, enabling
him to seize the best method instantaneously and
apply it to his purposes. At the same time, keeping
always in view the use of this material as the basis of
communicating information or convincing by making
explanations, he will be solicitous about his language.
Words will take on new values. He will be continually
searching for new ones to express the exact differences
of ideas he wants to convey. He will try different
expressions, various phrases, changed word orders,
to test their efficacy and appropriateness in transferring
his meaning to his hearers. Suggestions offered
in the chapter of this book on words and sentences
will never cease to operate in his thinking and speaking.
There will be a direct result in his ability as a
speaker and a reflex result upon his ability as a thinker.
What is more encouraging, he will realize and appreciate
these results himself, and his satisfaction in doing
better work will be doubled by the delight in knowing
exactly how he secured the ends for which he strove.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Explaining.</b> In order to make a matter
clear, to convey information, a speaker has at his
disposal many helpful ways of arranging his material.
Not all topics can be treated in all or even any certain
one of the following manners, but if the student is
familiar with certain processes he will the more easily
and surely choose just that one suited to the topic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>he intends to explain and the circumstances of his
exposition.</p>

<p><b>Division.</b> One of these methods is by division. A
speaker may separate a topic or term into the parts
which comprise it. For instance, a scientist may have
to list all the kinds of electricity; a Red Cross instructor
may divide all bandages into their several kinds; an
athletic coach may have to explain all the branches of
sports in order to induce more candidates to appear
for certain events; a banker may have to divide
financial operations to make clear an advertising
pamphlet soliciting new lines of business, such as
drawing up of wills.</p>

<p>The ability to do this is a valuable mental accomplishment
as well as an aid to speaking. In dividing,
care must be taken to make the separations according to
one principle for any one class. It would not result in
clearness to divide all men according to height, and
at the same time according to color. This would result
in confusion. Divide according to height first, then
divide the classes so formed according to color if
needed&mdash;as might be done in military formation.
Each group, then, must be distinctly marked off
from all other groups. In scientific and technical
matters such division may be carried to the extreme
limit of completeness. Complete division is called
classification.</p>

<p><b>Partition.</b> In non-scientific compositions such completeness
is seldom necessary. It might even defeat
the purpose by being too involved, by including too
many entries, and by becoming difficult to remember.
Speakers seldom have need of classification, but they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>often do have to make divisions for purposes of explanation.
This kind of grouping is called partition.
It goes only so far as is necessary for the purpose at
the time. It may stop anywhere short of being complete
and scientifically exact. All members of the
large class not divided and listed are frequently lumped
together under a last heading such as <i>all others, miscellaneous,
the rest, those not falling under our present
examination</i>.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Classify games. Which principle will you use for
your first main division&mdash;indoor and outdoor games, or
winter and summer games, or some other?</p>

your list complete?</p>

<p>5. Classify branches of mathematics. The entries may
total over a hundred.</p>

<p>6. Classify the pupils in your school.</p>

<p>7. Classify the people in your school. Is there any
difference?</p>

<p>8. Classify the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;">
The political parties of the country.<br />

Aircraft.<br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Skill in division is valuable not only as a method of
exposition but it is linked closely with an effective
method of proving to be explained in the next chapter&mdash;the
method of residues. Can you recall any extracts
given in this book in which some form of division
is used? Is this form of material likely to be more
important in preparation or in the finished speech?
Explain your opinion&mdash;in other words, present a
specimen of exposition.</p>

<p><b>Definition.</b> One of the simplest ways of explaining
is to define a term. Dictionary definitions are familiar
to everyone. In a great many instances the dictionary
definition is by means of synonyms. While this is a
convenient, easy method it is seldom exact. Why?
Recall what you learned concerning the meanings of
synonyms. Do they ever exactly reproduce one
another's meanings? There is always a slight degree
of inaccuracy in definition by synonym, sometimes a
large margin of inexactness. Is the following a good
definition?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A visitor to a school began his address: "This morning,
children, I propose to offer you an epitome of the life of
St. Paul. It may be perhaps that there are among you
some too young to grasp the meaning of the word <i>epitome</i>.
<i>Epitome</i>, children, is in its signification synonymous with
synopsis!"</p>

<p class="quotdate">London Tid-Bits</p>
</div>

<p><b>Logical Definition.</b> An exact definition is supplied
by the logical definition. In this there are three
parts&mdash;the term to be defined, the class (or genus)
to which it belongs, and the distinguishing characteristics
(differentia) which mark it off from all the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>members of that same class. You can represent this
graphically by inclosing the word <i>term</i> in a small circle.
Around this draw a larger circle in which you write
the word <i>class</i>. Now what divides the term from the
class in which it belongs? Indicate the line around
the <i>term</i> as <i>distinguishing characteristics</i>, and you will
clearly see how accurate a logical definition is. The
class should be just larger than the term itself. The
main difficulty is in finding exact and satisfying distinguishing
characteristics. There are some terms
which are so large that no classes can be found for
them. Others cannot be marked by acceptable distinguishing
characteristics, so it is not possible to make
logical definitions for all terms. Consider such words
as <i>infinity, electricity, gravity, man</i>.</p>

<p>The words of the definition should be simple, more
readily understood than the term to be defined.</p>

<p>
Man is a two-legged animal without feathers.<br />
Life is an epileptic fit between two nothings.<br />
Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains.<br />
The picture writings of the ancient Egyptians are called hieroglyphics.<br />
A fly is an obnoxious insect that disturbs you in the morning when you want to sleep.<br />
Real bravery is defeated cowardice.<br />
A brigantine is a small, two-masted vessel, square rigged on both masts, but with a fore-and-aft mainsail and the mainmast considerably longer than the foremast.<br />
A mushroom is a cryptogamic plant of the class <i>Fungi</i>; particularly the agaricoid fungi and especially the edible forms.<br />
Language is the means of concealing thought.<br />
A rectangle of equal sides is a square.<br />
Hyperbole is a natural exaggeration for the purpose of emphasis.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Amplified Definition.</b> While such definitions are
the first positions from which all interpretations must
proceed, in actual speech-making explanations of
terms are considerably longer. Yet the form of the
true logical definition is always imbedded&mdash;in germ
at least&mdash;in the amplified statement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Again, democracy will be, in a large sense, individualistic.
That ideal of society which seeks a disciplined, obedient
people, submissive to government and unquestioning in its
acceptance of orders, is not a democratic ideal. You cannot
have an atmosphere of "implicit obedience to authority"
and at the same time and in the same place an atmosphere
of democratic freedom. There is only one kind of discipline
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>that is adequate to democracy and that is self-discipline.
An observant foreigner has lately remarked, somewhat
paradoxically, that the Americans seemed to him the best
disciplined people in the world. In no other country does
a line form itself at a ticket office or at the entrance to a place
of amusement with so little disorder, so little delay, and so
little help from a policeman. In no other country would
an appeal of the government for self-control in the use of
food or fuel, for a restriction of hours of business, for "gas-less
Sundays," have met with so ready, so generous and so
sufficient a response. Our American lads, alert, adaptable,
swiftly-trained, self-directed, have been quite the equal
of the continental soldiers, with their longer technical training
and more rigorous military discipline. In these respects
the English, and especially the British colonial soldiers
have been much like our own. Democracy, whether for
peace or for war, in America or in England, favors individuality.
Independence of thought and action on the part
of the mass of the people are alike the result of democracy
and the condition of its continuance and more complete
development, and it is visibly growing in England as the
trammels of old political and social class control are being
thrown off.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Edward P. Cheyney: </span><i>Historical Tests of Democracy</i></p>

<p>What is a constitution? Certainly not a league, compact,
or confederacy, but a fundamental law. That fundamental
regulation which determines the manner in which the
public authority is to be executed, is what forms the constitution
of a state. Those primary rules which concern
the body itself, and the very being of the political society,
the form of government, and the manner in which power is
to be exercised&mdash;all, in a word, which form together the
constitution of a state&mdash;these are the fundamental laws.
This, Sir, is the language of the public writers. But do we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>need to be informed, in this country, what a constitution
is? Is it not an idea perfectly familiar, definite, and well
settled? We are at no loss to understand what is meant
by the constitution of one of the States; and the Constitution
of the United States speaks of itself as being an instrument
of the same nature.</p>

<p><b>Particulars of a General Statement.</b> A general
statement made at the beginning of a paragraph or
section, serving as the topic sentence, may then be
explained by breaking the general idea up into details
and particulars. This may partake of the nature of
both definition and partition, as the terms may be
explained and their component parts listed. Note
that in the following selection the first sentences state
the topic of the passage which the succeeding sentences
explain by discussing the phrase <i>variety of evils</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>So likewise a passionate attachment of one nation for
another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the
favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary
common interest, in cases where no real common interest
exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays
the former into a participation in the quarrels and
wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification.
It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of
privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure
the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting
with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting
jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties
from whom equal privileges are withheld, and it gives to
ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves
to the favorite nation), facility to betray, or sacrifice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes
even with popularity; gilding with the appearances
of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference
for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the
base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption or
infatuation.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">George Washington</span>: <i>Farewell Address</i>, 1796</p>
</div>

<p><b>Examples.</b> A statement may be explained by giving
examples. The speaker must be sure that his example
fits the case exactly; that it is typical&mdash;that is, it
must serve as a true instance of all cases under the
statement, not be merely an exception; that it is perfectly
clear; that it impresses the audience as unanswerable.
The example may be either actual or
suppositious, but it must illustrate clearly and accurately.
The use of examples is a great aid in explanation.
John C. Calhoun expressed the value very
distinctly in one of his speeches.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I know how difficult it is to communicate distinct ideas
on such a subject, through the medium of general propositions,
without particular illustration; and in order that I
may be distinctly understood, though at the hazard of being
tedious, I will illustrate the important principle which I
have ventured to advance, by examples.</p></div>

<p>By the use of an example he does make himself
distinctly understood.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Let us, then, suppose a small community of five persons,
separated from the rest of the world; and, to make the
example strong, let us suppose them all to be engaged in
the same pursuit, and to be of equal wealth. Let us further
suppose that they determine to govern the community by
the will of a majority; and, to make the case as strong as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>possible, let us suppose that the majority, in order to meet
the expenses of the government, lay an equal tax, say of
one hundred dollars on each individual of this little community.
Their treasury would contain five hundred dollars.
Three are a majority; and they, by supposition, have contributed
three hundred as their portion, and the other two
(the minority), two hundred. The three have the right
to make the appropriations as they may think proper.
The question is, How would the principle of the absolute
and unchecked majority operate, under these circumstances,
in this little community?</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">John C. Calhoun</span>: <i>Speech on The Force Bill</i>, 1833</p>
</div>

<p>The example should be taken from the same phase
of life as the proposition it explains. As Calhoun
was discussing governmental regulation he supposed
an example from majority rule. In the next the
topic is copyright, so the illustration is not taken from
patents. In introducing your own examples avoid the
trite, amateurish expression "take, for instance."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now, this is the sort of boon which my honorable and
learned friend holds out to authors. Considered as a boon
to them, it is a mere nullity; but, considered as an impost
on the public, it is no nullity, but a very serious and pernicious
reality. I will take an example. Dr. Johnson
died fifty-six years ago. If the law were what my honorable
and learned friend wishes to make it, somebody
would now have the monopoly of Dr. Johnson's works.
Who that somebody would be it is impossible to say; but
we may venture to guess. I guess, then, that it would
have been some bookseller, who was the assign of another
bookseller, who was the grandson of a third bookseller, who
had bought the copyright from Black Frank, the doctor's
servant and residuary legatee, in 1785 or 1786. Now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>would the knowledge that this copyright would exist in
1841 have been a source of gratification to Johnson? Would
it have stimulated his exertions? Would it have once drawn
him out of his bed before noon? Would it have once cheered
him under a fit of the spleen? Would it have induced him
to give us one more allegory, one more life of a poet, one
more imitation of Juvenal? I firmly believe not. I firmly
believe that a hundred years ago, when he was writing our
debates for the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, he would very much
rather have had twopence to buy a plate of shin of beef at
a cook's shop underground.</p>

<p><b>Comparison.</b> Unfamiliar matter may be made plain
by showing how it resembles something already clearly
understood by the audience. This is comparison. It
shows how two things are alike. The old geographies
used to state that the earth is an oblate spheroid, then
explain that term by comparison with an orange,
pointing out the essential flattening at the poles. In
any use of comparison the resemblance must be real,
not assumed. Many a speaker has been severely
criticized for his facts because he asserted in comparison
similarities that did not exist.</p>

<p><b>Contrast.</b> When the <i>differences</i> between two things
are carefully enumerated the process is termed contrast.
This is often used in combination with comparison,
for no two things are exactly alike. They
may resemble each other in nearly all respects, so
comparison is possible and helpful up to a certain
limit. To give an exact idea of the remainder the
differences must be pointed out; that requires
contrast.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>In contrast the opposing balance of details does
not have to depend necessarily on a standard familiar
to the audience. It may be an arrangement of opposite
aspects of the same thing to bring out more vividly
the understanding. In his <i>History of the English
People</i>, Green explains the character of Queen Elizabeth
by showing the contrasted elements she inherited from
her mother, Anne Boleyn, and her father, Henry VIII.
Such a method results not only in added clearness, but
also in emphasis. The plan may call for half a paragraph
on one side, the second half on the other; or
it may cover two paragraphs or sections; or it may
alternate with every detail&mdash;an affirmative balanced
by a negative, followed at once by another pair of
affirmative and negative, or statement and contrast,
and so on until the end. The speaker must consider
such possibilities of contrast, plan for his own, and indicate
it in his brief.</p>

<p>Nearly any speech will provide illustrations of the
methods of comparison and contrast. Burke's <i>Conciliation
with America</i> has several passages of each.</p>

<p><b>Cause to Effect.</b> Explanations based on progressions
from cause to effect and the reverse are admirably
suited to operations, movements, changes, conditions,
elections. An exposition of a manufacturing process
might move from cause to effect. A legislator trying
to secure the passage of a measure might explain its
operation by beginning with the law (the cause) and
tracing its results (the effect). So, too, a reformer
might plead for a changed condition by following the
same method. A speaker dealing with history or
biography might use this same plan.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Effect to Cause.</b> In actual events, the cause always
precedes the effect, but in discussion it is sometimes
better not to follow natural or usual orders.
Many explanations gain in clearness and effect by
working backwards. A voter might begin by showing
the condition of a set of workmen (an effect), then
trace conditions backward until he would end with a
plea for the repeal of a law (the cause). A student
might explain a low mark on his report by starting
with the grading (the effect) and tracing backwards
all his struggles to an early absence by which he missed
a necessary explanation by the teacher. A doctor
might begin a report by stating the illness of several
persons with typhus; then trace preceding conditions
step by step until he reached the cause&mdash;oysters eaten
by them in a hotel were kept cool by a dealer's letting
water run over them. This water in its course had
picked up the disease germs&mdash;the cause. Many
crimes are solved by moving from effect to cause. A
lawyer in his speeches, therefore, frequently follows
this method.</p>

<p>Both these methods are so commonly employed
that the student can cite instances from many speeches
he has heard or books he has read.</p>

<p><b>Time Order.</b> Somewhat similar to the two preceding
arrangements of exposition are the next two based on
time. The first of these is the natural time order, or
chronological order. In this the details follow one
another as events happened. It is to be noted, however,
that not any group of succeeding details will
make a good exposition of this sort. The parts must
be closely related. They must be not merely <i>sequential</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>but <i>consequential</i>. Dictionary definitions will explain
the difference in meaning of those two words. This
method is somewhat like the order from cause to effect,
but it is adapted to other kinds of topics and other
purposes of explanation. It is excellently suited
to historical material, or any related kind. It is the
device usually employed in explaining mechanical or
manufacturing processes. In mere frequency of occurrence
it is doubtlessly the most common.</p>

<p><b>Time Order Reversed.</b> The student who starts
to cast his expositions into this scheme should judge
its fitness for his particular purpose at the time. It
will often become apparent upon thought that instead
of the natural chronological order the exact opposite will
suit better. This&mdash;time order reversed&mdash;explains
itself as the arrangement from the latest occurrence
back through preceding events and details until the
earliest time is reached. It is quite like the arrangement
from effect back to cause. It might be used to
explain the legal procedure of a state or nation, to
explain treaty relations, to explain the giving up of
old laws. The movements of a man accused of crime
might be explained in this way. An alibi for a person
might be built up thus. The various versions of some
popular story told over and over again through a long
period of years might be explained after such a manner.</p>

<p>Although the time order reversed is not so common
as the chronological order it does occur many times.</p>

<p><b>Place.</b> Certain material of exposition demands the
order of place. This means that the details of the
explanation are arranged according to the position of
objects. If you have written many descriptions you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>are familiar with the problems brought up by such an
order. A few illustrations will make it clear. A man
on the street asks you how to reach a certain point in
the city. On what plan do you arrange your directions?
According to their place? You start to explain
to a friend the general lay-out of New York, or
Chicago, or San Francisco. How do you arrange the
details of your exposition? You attempt to convey
to another person the plan of some large building.
What arrangement is inevitable? How do books on
sports explain the baseball field, the football gridiron,
the tennis court, the golf links? When specifications
for a building are furnished to the contractor, what
principle of arrangement is followed? If an inventor
gives instructions to a pattern-maker for the construction
of a model, what plan does he follow? Would
a man discussing drawings for a new house be likely
to formulate his explanations on this scheme?</p>

<p>You see, then, how well suited such an arrangement
is to a variety of uses. In such expository passages
the transition and connecting words are mainly expressions
of place and relative position such as <i>to the
right, above, below, to the rear, extending upwards at an
angle of sixty degrees, dividing equally into three sections.</i>
Such indications must never be slighted in spoken
explanations. They keep the material clear and exact
in the hearer's comprehension. The speaker, remember,
can never assume that his audience is bound to
understand him. His task is to be so clear that no
single individual can fail to understand him.</p>

<p>Importance. It has already been stated&mdash;in the
chapter on planning&mdash;that topics may be arranged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>in the order of their importance. This same scheme
may be used in delivery of expository matter. A hearer
will follow the explanation if he be led gradually up
the ascent; he will remember most clearly the latter
part of the passage. If this include the prime factor
of the information he will retain it longest and most
clearly. You should listen to speeches of explanations
critically to judge whether the plans are good. Should
you make a list of the number of times any of the
plans here set down appears you will be struck by the
fact that while other orders are quite frequent, this
last principle of leading up to the most important
outranks all the others. It may be simply a form of
one of the others previously enumerated in which time
order, or contrast, or cause to effect is followed simply
because that does bring the most important last in
the discussion. Such an arrangement answers best
to the response made to ideas by people in audiences.
It is a principle of all attempts to instruct them, to
appeal to them, to stimulate them, to move them,
that the successive steps must increase in significance
and impressiveness until the most moving details be
laid before them. Analyze for yourself or for the
class a few long explanations you have listened to,
and report whether this principle was followed. Does
it bear any relation to concluding a speech with a
peroration?</p>

<p><b>Combinations of Methods.</b> While any one of the
foregoing methods may be used for a single passage
it is not usual in actual practice to find one scheme
used throughout all the explanatory matter of the
speech. In the first place, the attention of the au<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>dience
would very likely become wearied by the
monotony of such a device. Certain parts of the
material under explanation seem to require one treatment,
other portions require different handling. Therefore
good speakers usually combine two or more of
these plans.</p>

<p>Partition could hardly be used throughout an entire
speech without ruining its interest. It occurs usually
early to map out the general field or scope. Definition
also is likely to be necessary at the beginning of an
explanation to start the audience with clear ideas.
It may be resorted to at various times later whenever
a new term is introduced with a meaning the audience
may not entirely understand. Both partition and
definition are short, so they are combined with other
forms. Examples, likewise, may be introduced anywhere.</p>

<p>The two most frequently closely combined are comparison
and contrast. Each seems to require the
other. Having shown how two things or ideas are
alike, the speaker naturally passes on to secure more
definiteness by showing that with all their likenesses
they are not exactly the same, and that the differences
are as essential to a clear comprehension of them as
the similarities. So usual are they that many people
accept the two words as meaning almost the same
thing, though in essence they are opposites.</p>

<p>The other orders cannot be used in such close combinations
but they may be found in varying degrees
in many extended speeches of explanation as the
nature of the material lends itself to one treatment or
another. A twelve-hundred word discussion of <i>The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>Future of Food</i> uses examples, contrasted examples,
effect to cause, cause to effect (the phrase beginning a
paragraph is "there is already evidence that this has
resulted in a general lowering "), while the succeeding
parts grow in significance until the last is the most
important. A great English statesman in a speech
lasting some three hours on a policy of government
employed the following different methods at various
places where he introduced expository material&mdash;partition
(he claimed it was classification, but he
listed for consideration only three of the essential five
choices), contrast, comparison, time, example, place,
cause to effect. Some of these methods of arranging
explanatory matter were used several times.</p>

<h3>PROVING AND PERSUADING</h3>


<p><b>What Argumentation Is.</b> It is an old saying that
there are two sides to every question. Any speaker
who supports some opinion before an audience, who
advances some theory, who urges people to do a certain
thing, to vote a certain way, to give money for charitable
purposes, recognizes the opposite side. In trying
to make people believe as he believes, to induce
them to act as he advises, he must argue with them.
Argumentation, as used in this book, differs widely
from the informal exchange of opinions and views indulged
in across the dinner table or on the trolley
car. It does not correspond with the usual meaning
of argue and argument which both so frequently suggest
wrangling and bickering ending in ill-tempered
personal attacks. Argumentation is the well-considered,
deliberate means employed to convince others
of the truth or expediency of the views advocated by
the speaker. Its purpose is to carry conviction to
the consciousness of others. This is its purpose. Its
method is proof. Proof is the body of facts, opinions,
reasons, illustrations, conclusions, etc., properly arranged
and effectively presented which makes others
accept as true or right the proposition advanced by
the speaker. Of course, argumentation may exist
in writing but as this volume is concerned with oral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>delivery, the word speaker is used in the definition.
So much for the purpose and nature of argumentation.</p>

<p><b>Use of Argumentation.</b> Where is it used? Everywhere,
in every form of human activity. Argumentation
is used by a youngster trying to induce a
companion to go swimming and by a committee of
world statesmen discussing the allotment of territory.
In business a man uses it from the time he successfully
convinces a firm it should employ him as an office boy
until he secures the acceptance of his plans for a combination
of interests which will control the world market.
Lawyers, politicians, statesmen, clergymen, live by
argumentation. In the life of today, which emphasizes
so markedly the two ideas of individuality and efficiency,
argumentation is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>Any person can argue, in the ordinary sense of
stating opinions and views, in so far as any one can
converse. But to produce good, convincing argumentation
is not so easy as that. The expression of
personal preferences, opinions, ideas, is not argumentation,
although some people who advance so far as to
become speakers before audiences seem never to realize
that truth, and display themselves as pretending to
offer argumentation when they are in reality doing no
more than reciting personal beliefs and suggestions.</p>

<p>Cite instances of speakers who have indulged in
such personal opinions when they might or should
have offered arguments.</p>

<p>While argumentation is not so easily assembled as
running conversation is, it may be made quite as
fascinating as the latter, and just as surely as a person
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>can have his conversational ability developed so can
a person have his argumentative power strengthened.</p>

<p><b>Conviction.</b> What should be the first requisite of
a speaker of argumentation? Should it be conviction
in the truth or right of the position he takes and the
proposition he supports? At first thought one would
answer emphatically "yes." A great deal of discredit
has been brought upon the study of argumentation
by the practice of speakers to pretend to have opinions
which in reality they do not sincerely believe.
The practical instance is the willingness of paid lawyers
to defend men of whose guilt they must be sure. Such
criticism does not apply to cases in which there are
reasonable chances for opposing interpretations, nor
to those cases in which our law decrees that every
person accused of crime shall be provided with counsel,
but to those practices to which Lincoln referred when he
recommended the lawyer not to court litigation. Nor
should this criticism deter a student of public speaking
from trying his skill in defense of the other side, when
he feels that such practice will help him in weighing
his own arguments. In every instance of this highly
commendable double method of preparation which the
author has seen in classrooms, the speaker, after
his speech has been commented upon, has always
declared his real position and explained why he advocated
the opposite. Even school and college debating
has been criticized in the same way for becoming
not an attempt to discover or establish the truth
or right of a proposition, but a mere game with formal
rules, a set of scoring regulations, and a victory or
defeat with consequent good or bad effects upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>whole practice of undergraduate debating. If such
contests are understood in their true significance, as
practice in training, and the assumption of conviction
by a student is not continued after graduation so that
he will in real life defend and support opinions he really
does not believe, the danger is not so great. The man
who has no fixed principles, who can argue equally
glibly on any side of a matter, whose talents are at any
man's command of service, is untrustworthy. Convictions
are worthy elements in life. A man must
change his stand when his convictions are argued
away, but the man whose opinions shift with every
new scrap of information or influence is neither a safe
leader nor a dependable subordinate.</p>

<p>For the sake of the training, then, a student <i>may</i>
present arguments from attitudes other than his own
sincere conviction, but the practice should be nothing
more than a recognized exercise.</p>

<p>Because of its telling influence upon the opinion of
others let us, without further reservation, set down
that the first essential of a good argument is the ability
to convince others. Aside from the language and the
manner of delivery&mdash;two elements which must never
be disregarded in any speech&mdash;this ability to convince
others depends upon the proof presented to them
in support of a proposition. The various kinds and
methods of proof, with matters closely related to them,
make up the material of this chapter.</p>

<p><b>The Proposition.</b> In order to induce argument,
there must be a proposition. A proposition in argument
is a statement&mdash;a declarative sentence&mdash;concerning
the truth or expediency of which there may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>be two opinions. Notice that not every declarative
statement is a proposition for argument. "The sun
rises" is not a statement about which there can be
any varying opinions. It is not a proposition for
argument. But "Missionaries should not be sent
to China," and "John Doe killed Simon Lee," are
statements admitting of different opinions and beliefs.
They are propositions for argument. No sane person
would argue about such a statement as "Missionaries
are sent to China," nor would any one waste time on
such a statement as "Some day a man named John
Doe will kill a man named Simon Lee."</p>

<p>Although in common language we speak of arguing
a question the student must remember that such a
thing is impossible. You cannot argue about a question.
Nor can you argue about a subject or a topic.
The only expression about which there can be any
argument is a proposition. The question must be
answered. The resulting statement is then proved or
disproved. The topic must be given some definite
expression in a declarative sentence before any real
argument is possible. Even when the matter of argument
is incorrectly phrased as a topic or question you
will find almost immediately in the remarks the proposition
as a sentence. "Should women vote?" may
be on the posters announcing an address, but the
speaker will soon declare, "Women should vote in all
elections in the United States upon the same conditions
that men do." That is the proposition being
argued; the question has been answered.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Propositions.</b> Certain kinds of propositions
should never be chosen for argumentation. Many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>are incapable of proof, so any speech upon them would
result in the mere repetition of personal opinions.
Such are: The pen is mightier than the sword; Business
men should not read poetry; Every person should
play golf; Ancient authors were greater than modern
authors. Others are of no interest to contemporary
audiences and for that reason should not be presented.
In the Middle Ages scholars discussed such matters as
how many angels could stand on the point of a needle,
but today no one cares about such things.</p>

<p><b>Propositions of Fact.</b> Propositions fall into the
two classes already illustrated by the statements about
missionaries in China and the killing of Simon Lee.
The second&mdash;John Doe killed Simon Lee&mdash;is a
proposition of fact. All argument about it would
tend to prove either the affirmative or the negative.
One argument would strive to prove the statement a
fact. The other argument would try to prove its
opposite the actual fact. Facts are accomplished
results or finished events. Therefore propositions of
fact refer to the past. They are the material of argument
in all cases at law, before investigation committees,
and in similar proceedings. Lincoln argued
a proposition of fact when he took Douglas's statement,
"Our fathers, when they framed the government
under which we live, understood this question
just as well, and even better, than we do now," and
then proved by telling exactly how they voted upon
every measure dealing with slavery exactly what the
thirty-nine signers of the Constitution did believe
about national control of the practice. Courts of law
demand that pleadings "shall set forth with certainty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>and with truth the matters of fact or of law, the truth
or falsity of which must be decided to decide the case."</p>

<p><b>Propositions of Policy.</b> Notice that the other
proposition&mdash;Missionaries should not be sent to
China&mdash;is not concerned with a fact at all. It deals
with something which should or should not be done.
It deals with future conduct. It depends upon the
value of the results to be secured. It looks to the
future. It deals with some principle of action. It is
a question of expediency or policy. It induces argument
to show that one method is the best or not the
best. Propositions of expediency or policy are those
which confront all of us at every step in life. Which
college shall a boy attend? What kind of work shall
a woman enter? How large shall taxes be next year?
Which candidate shall we elect? How shall we better
the city government? How shall I invest my money?
What kind of automobile shall I buy? What kind of
will shall I make?</p>

<p>The answers to all such questions make propositions
of expediency or policy upon which arguments are
being composed and delivered every day.</p>

<p>In choosing propositions for argument avoid, 1, those
which are obviously truth; 2, those in which some
ambiguous word or term covers the truth; 3, those
in which the truth or error is practically impossible
of proof; 4, those involving more than one main issue;
5, those which do not interest the audience.</p>

<p><b>Wording the Proposition.</b> The proposition should
be accurately worded. In law if the word <i>burglary</i>
is used in the indictment, the defense, in order to
quash the charge, need show merely that a door
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>was unlocked. The phrasing should be as simple
and concise as possible. The proposition should not
cover too wide a field. Although these directions
seem self-evident they should be kept in mind continually.</p>

<p>When the proposition is satisfactory to the maker
of the argument he is ready to begin to build his proof.
In actual speech-making few arguments can be made
as convincing as a geometrical demonstration but a
speaker can try to make his reasoning so sound, his
development so cogent, his delivery so convincing,
that at the end of his speech, he can exclaim triumphantly,
"Quod erat demonstrandum."</p>

<p><b>Burden of Proof.</b> Every argument presupposes the
opposite side. Even when only one speaker appears
his remarks always indicate the possibility of opposite
views in the minds of some of the hearers. The
affirmative and negative are always present. It is
frequently asserted that the burden of proof is on the
negative. This is no more correct than the opposite
statement would be. The place of the burden of
proof depends entirely upon the wording of the proposition
and the statement it makes. In general the
burden of proof is upon the side which proposes any
change of existing conditions, the side which supports
innovations, which would introduce new methods.
With the passage of time the burden of proof may
shift from one side to the other. There was a time
when the burden of proof was upon the advocates of
woman suffrage; today it is undoubtedly upon the
opponents. At one period the opponents of the study
of Latin and Greek had the burden of proof, now the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>supporters of such study have it. Other topics upon
which the burden of proof has shifted are popular
election of Senators, prohibition, League of Nations,
self-determination of small nations, the study of vocations,
civics, and current topics in schools, an all-year
school term, higher salaries for teachers, the benefits of
labor unions, Americanization of the foreign born.</p>

<p><b>Evidence.</b> One of the best ways of proving a statement
is by giving evidence of its truth. Evidence is
made up of facts which support any proposition. In
court a witness when giving testimony (evidence) is
not allowed to give opinions or beliefs&mdash;he is continually
warned to offer only what he knows of the
fact. It is upon the facts marshaled before it that
the jury is charged to render its verdict.</p>

<p><b>Direct Evidence.</b> Evidence may be of two kinds&mdash;direct
and indirect. This second, especially in legal
matters, is termed circumstantial evidence. Direct
evidence consists of facts that apply directly to the
proposition under consideration. If a man sees a
street car passenger take a wallet from another man's
pocket and has him arrested at once and the wallet is
found in his pocket, that constitutes direct evidence.
Outside criminal cases the same kind of assured testimony
can be cited as direct evidence.</p>

<p><b>Circumstantial Evidence.</b> In most cases in court
such direct evidence is the exception rather than the
rule, for a man attempting crime would shun circumstances
in which his crime would be witnessed.
Indirect evidence&mdash;circumstantial evidence&mdash;is much
more usual. It lacks the certainty of direct evidence,
yet from the known facts presented it is often possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>to secure almost the same certainty as from direct
evidence. In serious crimes, such as murder, juries are
extremely cautious about convicting upon circumstantial
evidence. There are many chances of error
in making chains of evidence. In indirect evidence
a group of facts is presented from which a conclusion
is attempted. Suppose a boy had trouble with a
farmer and had been heard to threaten to get even.
One day the man struck him with a whip as he passed
on the road. That night the farmer's barn was set
on fire. Neighbors declared they saw some one
running from the scene. Next day the boy told his
companions he was glad of the loss. Circumstantial
evidence points to the boy as the culprit. Yet what
might the facts be?</p>

<p>In presenting arguments get as much direct evidence
as possible to prove your statements. When
direct evidence cannot be secured, link your indirect
evidence so closely that it presents not a single weak
link. Let the conclusion you draw from it be the
only possible one. Make certain no one else can
interpret it in any other way.</p>

<p>When you present evidence be sure it completely
covers your contention. Be sure it is clear. Be sure
it fits in with all the other facts and details presented.
Do not let it conflict with usual human experience.
Consider the sources of your evidence. If you do
not, you can be certain your audience will. Are your
sources reliable? Is the information authoritative? Is it
first-hand material, or merely hearsay? Is it unprejudiced?
Many of the other facts for evidence have already
been suggested in the chapter on getting material.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Two General Methods of Reasoning.</b> Frequently
the evidence to be used in argumentation must be
interpreted before it can be of any value, especially
when dealing with propositions of expediency or policy.
There are two general methods of reasoning. One is
the inductive method, the other the deductive.</p>

<p><b>Inductive Reasoning.</b> When we discover that a
certain operation repeated many times always produces
the same result we feel justified in concluding
that we can announce it as a universal law. After
thousands of falling bodies have been measured and
always give the same figures, scientists feel that they
may state the law that all falling bodies acquire an
acceleration of 32.2 feet per second. This illustrates
the inductive method of reasoning. In this system we
reason from the specific instance to the general law,
from the particular experiment to the universal theory,
from the concrete instance to the wide principle.</p>

<p>All modern science is based upon this method&mdash;the
experimental one. All general theories of any
kind today must&mdash;to be accepted&mdash;be supported
by long and careful consideration of all possible and
probable circumstances. The theory of evolution
as applied to the living things upon the earth is the
result of countless observations and experiments.</p>

<p><b>Hasty Generalization.</b> The speaker cannot himself
examine all the specific instances, he cannot consider
all the illustrations which might support his
position, but he must be careful of a too hasty generalization.
Having talked with a dozen returned
soldiers he may not declare that all American army
men are glad to be out of France, for had he investi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>gated
a little further he might have found an equal
number who regret the return to this land. He must
base his general statement on so many instances that
his conclusion will convince not only him, but people
disposed to oppose his view. He must be better prepared
to show the truth of his declaration than merely
to dismiss an example which does not fit into his scheme
by glibly asserting that "exceptions prove the rule."
He must show that what seems to contradict him is
in nature an exception and therefore has nothing at
all to do with his rule. Beginning speakers are quite
prone to this fault of too hasty generalization.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Write down five general theories or statements which
have been established by inductive reasoning.</p>

<p>2. Is there any certainty that they will stand unchanged
forever?</p>

<p>3. Under what circumstances are such changes made?</p>

<p>4. Can you cite any accepted laws or theories of past
periods which have been overturned?</p>


<p><b>Deductive Reasoning.</b> After general laws have
been established, either by human experience or
accepted inductive reasoning, they may be cited as
applying to any particular case under consideration.
This passing from the general law to the particular
instance is deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning
has a regular form called the syllogism.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >Major premise. </span><span style="margin-left:5em;" >All men are mortal.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >Minor premise. </span><span style="margin-left:5em;" >Socrates is a man.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >Conclusion.    </span><span style="margin-left:5em;" >Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</span><br />
</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>If the three parts of a syllogism are correct it has
absolute convincing power. Most attempts to disprove
its statement attack the first two statements.
Although it carries such an air of certainty it is likely
to many errors in use. An error like this is common:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >All horses are animals.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >All cows are animals.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >Therefore, all cows are horses.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Explain the fallacy in this syllogism.</p>

<p>Quite as frequently the incorrect syllogism is of this
kind.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >The edge of a stream is a bank.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >A bank is a financial institution.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >Therefore, the edge of a stream is a financial institution.</span><br />
</p>

<p>You will comment upon this that its evident silliness
would prevent any speaker from using such a
form in serious argument. But recall that in the
discussion of any idea a term may get its meaning
slightly changed. In that slight change of meaning
lurks the error illustrated here, ready to lead to false
reasoning and weakening of the argument. Certain
words of common use are likely to such shifting meanings&mdash;<i>republic,
equality, representative, monarchy, socialistic</i>.
Any doubtful passage in which such an
error is suspected should be reduced to its syllogistic
form to be tested for accuracy.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >A representative of the people must vote always as they would vote.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >A Congressman is a representative of the people.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:2em;" >Therefore, Congressmen must vote always as the people who elect them would vote.</span><br />
</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Is not the expression, <i>representative of the people</i>,
here used in two different senses?</p>

<p>When an argument is delivered, one of the premises&mdash;being
a statement which the speaker assumes
everyone will admit as true&mdash;is sometimes omitted.
This shortened form is called an enthymeme.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Smith will be a successful civil engineer for he is a
superior mathematician.</p></div>

<p>Supply the missing premise. Which is it?</p>

<p>In the bald, simple forms here set down, the syllogism
and enthymeme are hardly suited to delivery
in speeches. They must be amplified, explained, emphasized,
in order to serve a real purpose. The following
represent better the way a speaker uses deductive
reasoning.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The appointing power is vested in the President and
Senate; this is the general rule of the Constitution. The
removing power is part of the appointing power; it cannot
be separated from the rest.</p>

</div>

<p>Then Daniel Webster stated in rather extended
form the conclusion that the Senate should share in
the removing proceedings.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir, those who espouse the doctrines of nullification reject,
as it seems to me, the first great principle of all republican
liberty; that is, that the majority <i>must</i> govern. In matters
of common concern, the judgment of a majority <i>must</i> stand
as the judgment of the whole.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Proof.</b> In extended arguments, just as
in detailed exposition, many different methods of
proof may be employed.</p>

<p><b>Explanation.</b> Often a mere clear explanation will
induce a listener to accept your view of the truth of a
proposition. You have heard men say, "Oh, if that
is what you mean, I agree with you entirely. I simply
didn't understand you." When you are about to
engage in argument consider this method of exposition
to see if it will suffice. In all argument there is a great
deal of formal or incidental explanation.</p>

<p><b>Authority.</b> When authority is cited to prove a
statement it must be subjected to the same tests in
argument as in explanation. Is the authority reliable?
Is he unprejudiced? Does his testimony fit in with
the circumstances under consideration? Will his statements
convince a person likely to be on the opposing
side? Why has so much so-called authoritative information
concerning conditions in Europe been so
discounted? Is it not because the reporters are likely
to be prejudiced and because while what they say may
be true of certain places and conditions it does not
apply to all the points under discussion? The speaker
who wants the support of authority will test it as
carefully as though its influence is to be used against
him&mdash;as indeed, it frequently is.</p>

<p><b>Examples.</b> Where examples are used in argumentation
they must serve as more than mere illustrations.
In exposition an illustration frequently explains, but
that same example would have no value in argument
because while it illustrates it does not prove. A suppositious
example may serve in explanation; only a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>fact will serve as proof. The more inevitable its application,
the more clinching its effect, the better its
argumentative value. Notice how the two examples
given below prove that the heirs of a literary man
might be the very worst persons to own the copyrights
of his writings since as owners they might suppress
books which the world of readers should be able
to secure easily. While these examples illustrate, do
they not also prove?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I remember Richardson's grandson well; he was a clergyman
in the city of London; he was a most upright and excellent
man; but he had conceived a strong prejudice against
works of fiction. He thought all novel-reading not only
frivolous but sinful. He said&mdash;this I state on the authority
of one of his clerical brethren who is now a bishop&mdash;he said
that he had never thought it right to read one of his grandfather's
books.</p>

<p>I will give another instance. One of the most instructive,
interesting, and delightful books in our language is Boswell's
<i>Life of Johnson</i>. Now it is well known that Boswell's eldest
son considered this book, considered the whole relation of
Boswell to Johnson, as a blot in the escutcheon of the family.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Thomas Babington Macaulay</span>: <i>Copyright</i>, 1841</p>
</div>

<p><b>Analogy.</b> In argument by analogy the speaker attempts
to prove that because certain things are known
to be true in something that can be observed they are
likely to be true in something else which in so far as
it can be observed is quite like the first. We continually
argue by analogy in daily life. Lincoln was
really using analogy when he replied to the urging to
change his army leaders during the Civil War, that he
didn't think it wise to "swap horses while crossing a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>stream." Scientists use this method to draw conclusions
when it is impossible to secure from actual
observation or experiment a certain last step in the
reasoning. The planet Mars and the earth are similar
in practically all observable matters; they are about
the same distance from the sun, they have the same
surface conditions. The earth has living creatures
upon it. Hence&mdash;so goes the reasoning of analogy&mdash;Mars
is probably inhabited. Reasoning by analogy is
used to prove that universal suffrage is good for the
United States because it has been good for one particular
state. A student may argue by analogy that the elective
system should be introduced into all high schools,
because it has been followed in colleges. It may be
asserted that a leading bank president will make a
good university president, because he has managed
one complex institution. The essence of all good reasoning
by analogy is that the two things considered
must be so nearly alike in all that is known that the
presumption of belief is that they must also be alike in
the one point the arguer is trying to establish. This
is the test he must apply to his own analogy arguments.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our community frowns with indignation upon the profaneness
of the duel, having its rise in this irrational point
of honor. Are you aware that you indulge the same sentiment
on a gigantic scale, when you recognize this very
point of honor as a proper apology for war? We have
already seen that justice is in no respect promoted by war.
Is true honor promoted where justice is not?</p>

</div>

<p><b>Residues.</b> The method of residues is frequently
employed when the speaker is supporting a policy to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>be carried out, a measure to be adopted, a change to
be instituted, or a law to be passed. Granting the
assumption that something must be done he considers
all the various methods which may be employed, disposes
of them one by one as illegal, or unsuited, or
clumsy, or inexpedient, leaving only one, the one he
wants adopted, as the one which must be followed.</p>

<p>This is a good practical method of proof, provided the
speaker really considers <i>all</i> the possible ways of proceeding
and does show the undesirability of all except
the one remaining.</p>

<p>A speaker pleading for the installation of a commission
form of city control might list all the possible
ways of city government, a business manager, a mayor,
a commission. By disposing completely of the first
two, he would have proven the need for the last. A
good speaker will aways go farther than merely to
reach this kind of conclusion. He will, in addition to
disproving the unworthy choices, strongly support his
residue, the measure he wants adopted. In supporting
amounts of taxes, assessments, etc., this method
may be used. One amount can be proven so large as
to cause unrest, another so small as to be insufficient,
a third to produce a total just large enough to meet all
anticipated expenses with no surplus for emergencies;
therefore the correct amount must be just larger than
this but not reaching an amount likely to produce the
result caused by the first considered. Used in trials of
criminal cases it eliminates motives until a single inevitable
remainder cannot be argued away. This may
be the clue to follow, or it may be the last one of all
suspected persons. Burke considered several possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>ways of dealing with the American colonies; one he
dismissed as no more than a "sally of anger," a second
could not be operated because of the distance, a scheme
of Lord North's he proved would complicate rather than
settle matters, to change the spirit of America was
impossible, to prosecute it as criminal was inexpedient,
therefore but one way remained, to conciliate the spirit
of discontent by letting the colonies vote their own
taxes. It is interesting that what Burke described as
the sally of anger was the way the matter was actually
settled&mdash;Great Britain had to give up the American
colonies.</p>

<p>This method is also called elimination.</p>

<p><b>Cause to Effect.</b> Just as the explainer may pass
from cause to effect so may the arguer. Other names
for this method are antecedent probability and
<i>a priori</i> argument. In argument from a known cause
an effect is proven as having occurred or as likely to
occur. In solving crime this is the method which uses
the value of the motives for crime as known to exist in
the feelings or sentiments of a certain accused person.
A person trying to secure the passage of a certain law
will prove that it as the cause will produce certain
effects which make it desirable. Changed conditions
in the United States will be brought forward as the
cause to prove that the Federal government must do
things never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution.
Great military organization as the cause
of the recent war is used now in argument to carry on
the plea for the securing of peace by disarmament.</p>

<p>The main difficulty in reasoning from cause to effect is
to make the relationship so clear and so close that one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>thing will be accepted by everybody as the undisputed
cause of the alleged effect.</p>

<p><b>Effect to Cause.</b> In reasoning from effect to cause
the reverse method is employed. This is also termed
argument from sign or the <i>a posteriori</i> method. In it,
from some known effect the reasoning proves that it
is the result of a certain specified cause. Statistics
indicating business prosperity might be used as the
effect from which the arguer proves that they are
caused by a high protective tariff. A speaker shows
the good effects upon people to prove that certain
laws&mdash;claimed as the causes&mdash;should be extended in
application. Arguments from effect to cause may be
extremely far reaching; as every effect leads to some
cause, which is itself the effect of some other cause, and
so on almost to infinity. The good speaker will use
just those basic causes which prove his proposition&mdash;no more.</p>

<p>In actual practice the two forms of reasoning from
cause to effect and from effect to cause are frequently
combined to make the arguments all the more convincing.
Grouped together they are termed causal
relations.</p>

<p><b>Persuasion.</b> When a speaker has conclusively proven
what he has stated in his proposition, is his speech
ended? In some cases, yes; in many cases, no. Mere
proof appeals to the intellect only; it settles matters
perhaps, but leaves the hearer cold and humanly inactive.
He may feel like saying, "Well, even if what
you say is true, what are you going to do about it?"
Mathematical and scientific proofs exist for mere information,
but most arguments delivered before audi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>ences
have a purpose. They try to make people do
something. A group of people should be aroused to
some determination of purposeful thought if not to a
registered act at the time. In days of great stress the
appeal to action brought the immediate response in
military enlistments; in enrollment for war work; in
pledges of service; in signing membership blanks and
subscription blanks; in spontaneous giving.</p>

<p><b>Persuasion Produces a Response.</b> The end of most
argumentative speaking is to produce a response. It
may be the casting of a vote, the joining of a society,
the repudiation of an unworthy candidate, the demonstrating
of the solidarity of labor, the affiliating with
a religious sect, the changing of a mode of procedure,
the purchasing of a new church organ, the wearing of
simpler fashions, or any of the thousand and one things
a patient listener is urged to do in the course of his
usual life.</p>

<p>When the speaker passes on from mere convincing
to appealing for some response he has passed from
argumentation to persuasion. Nearly every argumentative
speech dealing with a proposition of policy shows
first what ought to be done, then tries to induce people
to do it, by appealing as strongly as possible to their
practical, esthetic, or moral interests. All such interests
depend upon what we call sentiments or feelings
to which worthy&mdash;note the word <i>worthy</i>&mdash;appeals
may legitimately be addressed. Attempts to arouse
unworthy motives by stirring up ignorance and prejudice
are always to be most harshly condemned. Such
practices have brought certain kinds of so-called persuasion
into well-deserved contempt. The high sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>ing
spell-binder with his disgusting spread-eagleism
cannot be muzzled by law, but he may be rendered
harmless by vacant chairs and empty halls. Real
eloquence is not a thing of noise and exaggeration.
Beginning speakers should avoid the tawdry imitation
as they would a plague.</p>

<p><b>Elements of Persuasion.</b> What elements may aid
the persuasive power of a speech? First of all, the
occasion may be just the right one. The surroundings
may have prepared the audience for the effect the
speaker should make if he knows how to seize upon
the opportunity for his own purpose. The speaker
must know how to adapt himself to the circumstances
present. In other cases, he must be able to do the
much more difficult thing&mdash;adapt the circumstances
to his purpose.</p>

<p>Secondly, the subject matter itself may prepare for
the persuasive treatment in parts. Everyone realizes
this. When emotional impulses are present in the
material the introduction of persuasion is inevitable
and fitting, if not overdone.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the essence of persuasion depends upon the
speaker. All the good characteristics of good speaking
will contribute to the effect of his attempts at persuasion.
A good speaker is sincere to the point of
winning respect even when he does not carry conviction.
He is in earnest. He is simple and unaffected.
He has tact. He is fair to every antagonistic attitude.
He has perfect self-control. He does not lose his
temper. He can show a proper sense of humor. He
has genuine sympathy. And finally&mdash;perhaps it includes
all the preceding&mdash;he has personal magnetism.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>With such qualities a speaker can make an effective
appeal by means of persuasion. If upon self-criticism
and self-examination, or from outside kindly comment,
he concludes he is lacking in any one of these qualities
he should try to develop it.</p>

<h3>REFUTING</h3>


<p><b>Answering the Other Side</b>. It has been said already
that even in a single argumentative speech some
account must be taken of the possibility among the
audience of the belief in other views. A speaker must
always assume that people will believe otherwise than
he does. In such cases as debate or questioning after
a speech is made, this opposing side will very clearly
be brought out, so that any person training for any
kind of public speaking will give much attention to the
contentions of others in order to strengthen his own
convictions as displayed in his speeches.</p>

<p>A sincere thinker may believe that trial before a
group of competent judges is a better procedure than
trial by jury. Were he to speak upon such a proposition
he would realize that he would meet at once the
solid opposition of the general opinion that jury trials,
sanctioned by long practice, are in some mysterious
way symbolic of the liberty and equality of mankind.
Before he could expect to arouse sympathetic understanding
he would have to answer all the possible objections
and reasons against his new scheme. This
he would do by refutation, by disproving the soundness
of the arguments against his scheme. He could cite
the evident and recorded injustices committed by
juries. He could bring before them the impossibility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>of securing an intelligent verdict from a group of
farmers, anxious to get to their farms for harvest,
sitting in a case through July, while the days passed
in lengthy examinations of witnesses&mdash;one man was
on the stand eight days&mdash;and the lawyers bandied
words and names like socialist, pagan, bolsheviki,
anarchy, ideal republic, Aristotle, Plato, Herbert
Spencer, Karl Marx, Tolstoi, Jane Addams, Lenin.
Then when he felt assured he had removed all the
reasons for supporting the present jury system he
could proceed to advance his own substitute.</p>

<p><b>Need and Value of Refutation</b>. In all argumentation,
therefore, refutation is valuable and necessary.
By it opposing arguments are reasoned away, their
real value is determined, or they are answered and
demolished if they are false or faulty. To acquire any
readiness as a speaker or debater a person must pay a
great deal of attention to refutation. It has also an
additional value. It has been stated that every argumentative
speaker must study the other side of every
question upon which he is to speak. One great debater
declared that if he had time to study only one
side of a proposition or law case he would devote that
time to the other side. Study your own position from
the point of view of the other side. Consider carefully
what arguments that side will naturally advance.
In fact, try to refute your own arguments exactly as
some opponent would, or get some friend to try to
refute your statements. Many a speaker has gained
power in reasoning by having his views attacked by
members of his family who would individually and
collectively try to drive him into a corner. In actual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>amount, perhaps you will never deliver as much refutation
of an opponent as you will conjure up in your
mind against your own speeches. Perhaps, also, this
great amount advanced by you in testing your own
position will prevent your opponents from ever finding
in your delivered arguments much against which they
can pit their own powers of refutation.</p>

<p>In judging your own production you will have to
imagine yourself on the other side, so the methods will
be the same for all purposes of self-help or weakening
of an opponent's views.</p>

<p><b>Contradiction Is Not Refutation</b>. In the first place
contradiction is not refutation. No unsupported fact
or statement has any value in argumentation. Such
expressions as "I don't believe, I don't think so, I
don't agree" introduce not arguments, but personal
opinions. You must, to make your refutation valuable,
<i>prove</i> your position. Never allow your attempts at refutation
to descend to mere denial or quibbling. Be
prepared to support, to prove everything you say.</p>

<p><b>Three Phases of Refutation.</b> In general, refutation
consists of three phases:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em;" >
1. The analysis of the opposite side.<br />
2. The classification of the arguments according to importance.<br />
3. The answering of only the strongest points.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Analysis of Opposing Side for Accuracy</b>. In the
first analysis, you will probably examine the opposing
statements to test their accuracy. Mere slips, so
evident that they deceive no one, you may disregard
entirely, but gross error of fact or conclusion you
should note and correct in unmistakably plain terms.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>The kind of statement which gives insufficient data
should be classed in analysis with this same kind of
erroneous statement. A shoe dealer in arguing for
increased prices might quote correctly the rising cost
of materials, but if he stopped there, you in refutation
should be able to show that profits had already risen
to 57%, and so turn his own figures against him.
Another class of refutation similar to this is the questioning
of authorities. Something concerning this has
already been said. In a recent trial a lawyer cast doubt
upon the value of a passage read from a book by declaring
its author could never have written such a
thing. In refutation the opposing lawyer said, "You
will find that passage on page 253 of his <i>Essays and
Letters."</i> Public speakers, realizing that errors of
statement are likely to be the first to be picked out for
correction, and recognizing the damaging effect of
such conviction in error of fact and testimony, are
extremely careful not to render themselves liable to
attack upon such points. Yet they may. We are
told by Webster's biographers that in later periods of
his life he was detected in errors of law in cases being
argued before the court, and refuted in statement. To
catch such slips requires two things of the successful
speaker. He must be in possession of the facts himself.
He must be mentally alert to see the falsity and
know how to answer it.</p>

<p><b>Begging the Question</b>. The expression "begging
the question" is often heard as a fallacy in argument.
In its simplest form it is similar to inaccurate statement,
for it includes assertions introduced without
proof, and the statement of things as taken for granted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>without attempting to prove them, yet using them to
prove other statements. Sometimes, also, a careless
thinker, through an extended group of paragraphs will
end by taking as proven exactly the proposition he
started out to prove, when close analysis will show
that nowhere during the discussion does he actually
prove it. As this is frequent in amateur debates,
students should be on their guard against it.</p>

<p><b>Ignoring the Question</b>. The same kind of flimsy
mental process results in ignoring the question. Instead
of sticking closely to the proposition to be proved
the speaker argues beside the point, proving not the
entire proposition but merely a portion of it. Or in
some manner he may shift his ground and emerge,
having proven the wrong point or something he did
not start out to consider. An amateur theatrical producer
whose playhouse had been closed by the police
for violating the terms of his license started out to
defend his action, but ended by proving that all men
are equal. In fact he wound up by quoting the poem
by Burns, "A Man's a Man for A' That." Such a
shifting of propositions is a frequent error of speakers.
It occurs so often that one might be disposed to term
it a mere trick to deceive, or a clever though unscrupulous
device to secure support for a weak claim. One
of the first ways for the speaker to avoid it is to be able
to recognize it when it occurs. One of the most quoted
instances of its effective unmasking is the following
by Macaulay.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The advocates of Charles, like the advocates of other
malefactors against whom overwhelming evidence is produced,
generally decline all controversy about the facts, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>content themselves with calling testimony to character.
He had so many private virtues! And had James the
Second no private virtues! Was Oliver Cromwell, his
bitterest enemies themselves being judges, destitute of
private virtues? And what, after all, are the virtues ascribed
to Charles? A religious zeal, not more sincere than
that of his son, and fully as weak and narrow-minded, and
a few of the ordinary household decencies which half the
tombstones in England claim for those who lie beneath
them. A good father! A good husband! Ample apologies
indeed for fifteen years of persecution, tyranny, and falsehood!</p>

<p>We charge him with having broken his coronation oath;
and we are told that he kept his marriage vow! We accuse
him of having given up his people to merciless inflictions
of the most hot-headed and hard-hearted of prelates; and
the defence is, that he took his little son on his knee and
kissed him! We censure him for having violated the articles
of the Petition of Right, after having, for good and valuable
consideration, promised to observe them; and we are informed
that he was accustomed to hear prayers at six o'clock
in the morning! It is to such considerations as these, together
with his Vandyke dress, his handsome face, and his
peaked beard, that he owes, we verily believe, most of his
popularity with the present generation.</p></div>

<p><b>Appealing to Prejudice or Passions</b>. The question
is also ignored when the speaker appeals to the prejudices
or passions of his audience (<i>argumentum ad
populum</i>). Persons of some intellect resent this as
almost an insult if they are in the audience, yet it is
often resorted to by speakers who would rather produce
the effect they desire by the use of any methods, right
or wrong. Its use in court by unscrupulous lawyers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>to win decisions is checked by attempts on the part of
judges to counteract it in their charges to the jury, but
its influence may still persist. Mark Antony in
Shakespere's play, <i>Julius Caesar</i>, used it in his oration
over the dead body of Caesar to further his own ends.</p>

<p>Taking Advantage of Ignorance. Just as a speaker
may take advantage of the prejudices and passions of
an audience, so he may take advantage of their ignorance.
Against the blankness of their brains he may
hurl unfamiliar names to dazzle them, cite facts of all
kinds to impress them, show a wide knowledge of all
sorts of things, "play up to them" in every way, until
they become so impressed that they are ready to accept
as truth anything he chooses to tell them. Any
daily paper will provide examples of the sad results
of the power of this kind of fallacious reasoning. The
get-rich-quick schemes, the worthless stock deals, the
patent medicine quacks, the extravagantly worded
claims of new religions and faddist movements, all
testify to the power this form of seemingly convincing
argument has over the great mass of the ignorant.</p>

<p><b>The Fallacy of Tradition.</b> In discussing the burden
of proof it was said that such burden rests upon the
advocate of change, or novel introductions, etc. This
tendency of the people at large to be rather conservative
in practice links with the fallacy of tradition, the belief
that whatever is, is right. In many cases such a faith
is worse than wrong, it is pernicious. Many of the
questions concerning relations of modern society&mdash;as
capital and labor&mdash;are based upon this fallacy.
Henry Clay was guilty of it when he announced,
"Two hundred years of legislation have sanctioned and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>sanctified negro slaves as property." The successful
way to dispose of such a fallacy is illustrated by
William Ellery Channing's treatment of this statement.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But this property, we are told, is not to be questioned on
account of its long duration. "Two hundred years of legislation
have sanctioned and sanctified negro slaves as property."
Nothing but respect for the speaker could repress
criticism on this unhappy phraseology. We will trust it
escaped him without thought. But to confine ourselves to
the argument from duration; how obvious the reply! Is
injustice changed into justice by the practice of the ages?
Is my victim made a righteous prey because I have bowed
him to the earth till he cannot rise? For more than two
hundred years heretics were burned, and not by mobs, not
by lynch law, but by the decrees of the councils, at the instigation
of theologians, and with the sanction of the laws
and religions of nations; and was this a reason for keeping
up the fires, that they had burned two hundred years?
In the Eastern world successive despots, not for two hundred
years, but for twice two thousand have claimed the right of
life and death over millions, and, with no law but their own
will, have beheaded, bowstrung, starved, tortured unhappy
men without number who have incurred their wrath; and
does the lapse of so many centuries sanctify murder and
ferocious power?</p></div>

<p><b>Attacking a Speaker's Character or Principles</b>.
Sometimes a speaker who finds himself unable to attack
the truth of a proposition, or the arguments cited
to support it, changes his tactics from the subject-matter
to the opponent himself and delivers an attack
upon his character, principles, or former beliefs and
statements. This is called the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.
In no sense is it really argument; it is irrelevant attack,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>and should be answered in a clear accurate demonstration
of its unsuitability to the topic under consideration.
It is unworthy, of course, but it is a tempting device
for the speaker who can combine with it an appeal to
the prejudices or passions of his audience.</p>

<p>The author has seen the entire population of Rome
agitated because in a Senatorial debate one speaker attacked
the family reputation of one of his opponents&mdash;a
matter which, even if true, certainly had nothing to
do with the bill under discussion. Political campaigns
used to be disgraced by a prevalence of such appeals for
votes. We may pride ourselves upon an advance in
such matters, but there is still too much of it to let us
congratulate ourselves upon our political good manners.
You cannot ascribe bad faith to a man who argues now
from a different attitude from the one he formerly supported.
Changes of conviction are frequent in all
matters. A man must be judged by the reasons he
gives for his position at any one time. Many a person,
who ten years ago would have argued against it, now
believes a League of Nations possible and necessary.
Many a person who a few years back could see no advantage
in labor organizations is anxious now to join
an affiliated union.</p>

<p>If you find the suggestion of such an attack in any
of your own speeches, cast it out. If it is ever used
against you, refute it by the strength of arguments you
deliver in support of your position. Remove all assertions
which do not relate to the debated topic. Make
your audience sympathize with your repudiation of the
remarks of your opponent, even though he has succeeded
in delivering them.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Fallacies of Causal Relationship</b>. The various fallacies
that may be committed under the relation of
cause and effect are many. Just because something
happened prior to something else (the effect), the first
may be mistakenly quoted as the cause. Or the reverse
may be the error&mdash;the second may be assumed
to be the effect of the first. The way to avoid this
fallacy was suggested in the discussion of explanation
by means of cause and effect where the statement was
made that two events must not be merely <i>sequential</i>,
they must be <i>consequential</i>. In argument the slightest
gap in the apparent relationship is likely to result in
poor reasoning, and the consequent fallacy may be
embodied in the speech. When people argue to prove
that superstitions have come true, do they present clear
reasoning to show conclusively that the alleged cause&mdash;such
as sitting thirteen at table&mdash;actually produced
the effect of a death? Do they <i>establish</i> a close causal
relationship, or do they merely <i>assert</i> that after a group
of thirteen had sat at table some one did die? Mathematically,
would the law of chance or probability not
indicate that such a thing would happen a little less
surely if the number had been twelve, a little more
surely if fourteen?</p>

<p>Common sense, clear headedness, logical reasoning,
and a wide knowledge of all kinds of things will enable
a speaker to recognize these fallacies, anticipate them,
and successfully refute them.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Refuting</b>. Having found the fallacies
in an argument you should proceed to refute them.
Just how you can best accomplish your purpose of
weakening your opponent's position, of disposing of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>arguments, of answering his contentions, must depend
always upon the particular circumstances of the occasion,
of the material presented, of the attitude of the
judges or audience, of your opponent himself, and of
the purpose you are striving to accomplish. Practice,
knowledge, skill, will in such cases all serve your end.
You should be able to choose, and effectively use the
best. It is impossible to anticipate and provide for all
the possibilities, but a few of the most common probabilities
and the methods of dealing with them can be
here set down.</p>

<p><b>Courteous Correction</b>. In case of apparent error or
over-sight you will do well to be courteous rather than
over-bearing and dictatorial in your correction. Never
risk losing an advantage by driving your audience into
sympathy for your opponent by any manner of your
own. A newspaper discussing the objections made to
the covenant of the League of Nations points out an
over-sight in this way: "How did Senator Knox happen
to overlook the fact that his plan for compulsory arbitration
is embodied in Article XII of the proposed
covenant?"</p>

<p><b>Refuting Incorrect Analogy</b>. The caution was given
that reasoning from analogy must show the complete
correspondence in all points possible of the known from
which the reasoning proceeds to the conclusion about
the unknown, which then is to be accepted as true.
Unless that complete correspondence is established
firmly the speaker is likely to have his carefully
worked out analogy demolished before his eyes.
Notice how such refutation is clearly demonstrated in
the following.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>So it does; but the sophistry here is plain enough, although
it is not always detected. Great genius and force of character
undoubtedly make their own career. But because
Walter Scott was dull at school, is a parent to see with joy
that his son is a dunce? Because Lord Chatham was of a
towering conceit, must we infer that pompous vanity portends
a comprehensive statesmanship that will fill the world
with the splendor of its triumphs? Because Sir Robert Walpole
gambled and swore and boozed at Houghton, are we to
suppose that gross sensuality and coarse contempt of human
nature are the essential secrets of a power that defended
liberty against tory intrigue and priestly politics? Was it
because Benjamin Franklin was not college-bred that he
drew the lightning from heaven and tore the scepter from
the tyrant? Was it because Abraham Lincoln had little
schooling that his great heart beat true to God and man,
lifting him to free a race and die for his country? Because
men naturally great have done great service in the world without
advantages, does it follow that lack of advantage is the
secret of success?</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">George William Curtis</span>: <i>The Public Duty of Educated Men</i>, 1877</p>
</div>

<p><b>Reducing Proof to Absurdity.</b> A very good way of
showing the unreliability of an opposing argument is
to pretend to accept it as valid, then carrying it on to
a logical conclusion, to show that its end proves entirely
too much, or that it reduces the entire chain of
reasoning to absurdity. This is, in fact, called <i>reductio
ad absurdum</i>. At times the conclusion is so plainly
going to be absurd that the refuter need not carry its
successive steps into actual delivery. In speaking to
large groups of people nothing is better than this for
use as an effective weapon. It gives the hearers the
feeling that they have assisted in the damaging demon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>stration.
It almost seems as though the speaker who
uses it were merely using&mdash;as he really is&mdash;material
kindly presented to him by his opponent. So the two
actually contribute in refuting the first speaker's
position.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Congress only can declare war; therefore, when one State
is at war with a foreign nation, all must be at war. The
President and the Senate only can make peace; when peace
is made for one State, therefore, it must be made for all.</p>

<p>Can anything be conceived more preposterous, than that
any State should have power to nullify the proceedings of the
general government respecting peace and war? When war
is declared by a law of Congress, can a single State nullify
that law, and remain at peace? And yet she may nullify
that law as well as any other. If the President and Senate
make peace, may one State, nevertheless, continue the war?
And yet, if she can nullify a law, she may quite as well nullify
a treaty.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Daniel Webster</span>: <i>The Constitution Not a Compact between
    <br />
  Sovereign States</i>, 1833</p>
</div>

<p>Lincoln could always use this method of <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> most effectively because he seldom failed to
accentuate the absurdity by some instance which made
clear to the least learned the force of his argument.
Many of his best remembered quaint and picturesque
phrases were embodied in his serious demolition of
some high-handed presumption of a political leader.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Under all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves
justified to break up this government unless such a
court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a
conclusive and final rule of political action? But you will
not abide the election of a Republican President! In that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and
then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be
upon us! That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to
my ear, and mutters through his teeth, "Stand and deliver,
or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!"</p>

</div>

<p><b>Amplifying and Diminishing.</b> Finally a good method
of refuting the claim of importance made for an opposing
proposition is by amplifying and diminishing.
In plain terms this depends upon contrast in which you
reduce the value of the opposing idea and emphasize
the value of your own. An excellent use for this is as a
rapid summary at the end of your speech, where it will
leave in the hearer's mind an impression of the comparative
value of the two views he has heard discussed,
with an inevitable sense of the unquestioned worth of
one above the other. Burke sums up his extended
refutations of Lord North's plan for dealing with
America in these telling contrasts.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Compare the two. This I offer to give you is plain and
simple; the other full of perplexed and intricate mazes. This
is mild; that harsh. This found by experience effectual for
its purposes; the other is a new project. This is universal;
the other calculated for certain colonies only. This is immediate
in its conciliatory operation; the other remote,
contingent, full of hazard. Mine is what becomes the dignity
of a ruling people&mdash;gratuitous, unconditional&mdash;and
not held out as a matter of bargain and sale.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Edmund Burke</span>: <i>Conciliation with America</i>, 1775</p>
</div>

<p><b>Position of Refutation in the Speech.</b> The position
of refutation in the finished speech will depend always
upon the nature of the proposition, the exact method
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>of the refutation, and the audience. If you are making
the only speech upon the proposition and you feel that
the audience may have a slight prejudice against what
you are about to urge, you may gain adherents at once
by refuting at the beginning the possible arguments
in their minds. By this procedure you will clear the
field for your own operations. To change the figure of
speech, you erase from the slate what is already written
there, so that you may place upon it your own speech
and its convictions.</p>

<p>If you are debating and the speaker just before you
has evidently made the judges accept his arguments,
again you might remove that conviction by refutation
before you proceed to build up your own side. If your
regular arguments meet his squarely, proceed as you
had planned, but be sure when any reasoning you offer
nullifies any he has delivered, that you call the attention
of the audience to the fact that you have wiped out
his score. In this way your constructive argument
and refutation will proceed together. You will save
valuable time.</p>

<p><b>Constructive Argument Is More Valuable than Refutation.</b>
Often the rebuttal speeches of debate, coming
at the close of the regular debate speeches, seem
reserved for all the refutation. This is certainly the
place for much refutation, certainly not all. The last
speakers of the rebuttal speeches should never rest
content with leaving only refutation in the hearers'
minds. If they do, the debate may leave the condition
entirely where it was at the beginning, for theoretically
every argument advanced by either side has
been demolished by the other. After the rebuttal the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>last points left with the judges should be constructive
arguments.</p>

<p>In a single speech the refutation may be delivered in
sections as the demands of coherence and the opportunities
for emphasis may suggest. Here again, always
make the last section a constructive one with arguments
in support of your proposition.</p>

<h3>DEBATING</h3>


<p><b>The Ideal of Debating.</b> A long time ago so admirable
a man as William Penn stated the high ideal
of all real debating whether practised in the limited
range of school interests or in the extended field of life's
activities.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In all debates let truth be thy aim, not victory, or an
unjust interest; and endeavor to gain, rather than to expose
thy antagonist.</p></div>

<p>The quotation states exactly the true aim of all
debating&mdash;the conclusion of the right, the truth
rather than the securing of a decision over an opponent.
The same rules which animate the true lover of sports,
the clear distinction which is instilled into all participants
of amateur athletics of the meanings and
significance of the two terms <i>sportsman</i> and <i>sport</i>, can
be carried over to apply to school activities in debating.
Honest differences of opinion among people upon
countless questions will always furnish enough material
for regular debating so that no one need ever do
violence to his convictions.</p>

<p><b>Value of Debate.</b> One of the greatest educational
values of practice in debate is that the ability it develops
can be applied instantly in the life beyond the
schoolroom, that it operates in every person's daily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>life. There are differences in the manner in which
debating is carried on in the two places, but practice
in the earlier will result in skill and
self-confidence in the second.</p>

<p><b>Debate in Actual Life.</b> The most marked difference
between debates in the two phases of life is the difference
of form. In academic circles debate is a well-regulated
game between matched sides. In actual life
only in certain professions are the rules well defined.
In most cases the debating is disguised under different
forms, though the essential purposes and methods are
the same.</p>

<p>Debate between lawyers in courts&mdash;technically
termed pleading&mdash;is the most formal of all professional
debating. Its regulations are found in the stabilized court
procedure which every lawyer must master and obey.</p>

<p>Much looser than the formal debate of the court
room is the speech-making of the legislative organization
from the lowest township board meeting up to
the Senate of the United States. Of course the members
of such bodies are regulated by certain restrictions,
but the speeches are not likely to be curbed in time as
are academic performances, nor are the speakers likely
to follow a prearranged order, nor are they always
equally balanced in number, nor do they agree so carefully
upon "team work." Sometimes in a legislative
body the first speaker may be on the negative side,
which is quite contrary to all the rules of regularly conducted
debates. All the speakers may also be on one
side of a measure, the opposing side not deigning to
reply, resting secure in the knowledge of how many votes
they can control when the real test of power comes.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>Most informal of all are the general discussions in
which business matters are decided. In these the
speeches are never so set as in the two preceding kinds.
The men are less formal in their relations and addresses
to one another. The steps are less marked in their
changes. Yet underneath the seeming lack of regulation
there is the framework of debate, for there is
always present the sense of two sides upon every
proposition, whether it be the purchase of new office
equipment for a distant agent, an increase of salary
for employees, or the increase of capitalization. Certain
speakers support some proposition. Others oppose it
until they are convinced and won over to the affirmative
side, or until they are out-voted.</p>

<p>Two men seated in an office may themselves be
debaters, audience, and judges of their own argumentative
opinions. They may in themselves fill all the
requirements of a real debate. They deliver the
speeches on the affirmative and negative sides. Each
listens to the arguments of his opponent. And finally,
the pair together give a decision upon the merits of the
arguments presented.</p>

<p>On all such occasions the speakers need and use
just those qualities which classroom training has
developed in them&mdash;knowledge of material, plan of
presentation, skill in expression, conviction and persuasion
of manner, graceful acceptance of defeat.</p>

<p><b>Debating Demands a Decision.</b> Debating goes one
step farther than merely argumentative speaking.
Debating demands a decision upon the case, it requires
a judgment, a registered action. Again in this respect
it is like a game.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Make a list of propositions which have been debated
or might be debated in a courtroom.</p>

<p>2. Make another list of propositions which have been
debated or might be debated in legislative bodies.</p>

<p>3. Make a list of propositions which might be debated in
business.</p>

<p>4. As far as is possible, indicate the decisions upon them.</p>

<p>5. Choose some proposition on which there is considerable
difference of opinion in the class. Make a list of those who
favor and those who oppose. Speak upon the proposition,
alternating affirmative and negative.</p>

<p>6. Discuss the speeches delivered in the fifth exercise.</p>

<p><b>Persons Involved in a Debate.</b> Who are the persons
involved in a regular debate? They are the presiding
officer, the speakers themselves, the audience, the
judges.</p>

<p><b>The Presiding Officer</b>. Every debate has a presiding
officer. The Vice-President of the United States
is the presiding officer of the Senate. The Speaker is
the presiding officer of the House of Representatives.
If you will refer to Chapter IV on <i>Beginning the Speech</i>
you will see several other titles of presiding officers.
In school debates the head of the institution may act
in that capacity, or some person of note may be invited
to preside. In regular classroom work the instructor
may serve as presiding officer, or some member of the
class may be chosen or appointed. The latter method
is the best&mdash;after the instructor has shown by example
just what the duties of such a position are.</p>

<p>The presiding officer should announce the topic of
debate in a short introductory speech. He should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>read the names of the speakers on the affirmative and
those on the negative side. He should stipulate the
terms of the debate&mdash;length of each speech, time for
rebuttal, order of rebuttal, method of keeping speakers
within time limits, conditions of judgment (material,
presentation, etc.), announce the judges, and finally
introduce the first speaker; then the subsequent
speakers. At the close he might refer to the fact of the
debate's being ended, he might rehearse the conditions
of judgment, and request the judges to retire to consider
their decision. Practice varies as to who shall
deliver the decision of the judges to the audience.
Sometimes the chairman elected by the judges announces
the decision. Sometimes the judges hand the
decision to the presiding officer who announces it.</p>

<p><b>The Debaters.</b> Beyond saying that the speakers
must do their best, there is nothing to be added here
about their duty in the debate except to issue one
warning to them in connection with the next personal
element to be considered&mdash;the audience.</p>

<p><b>The Audience.</b> Debaters must remember that in
practically no circumstances outside legislative bodies
are the audience and the judges ever the same. Debaters
argue to convince the judges&mdash;not the entire
audience, who are really as disconnected from the
decision of the debate as are the straggling spectators
and listeners in a courtroom detached from the jury
who render the verdict of guilty or not guilty. The
debater must therefore speak for the judges, not for
his audience. Many a debating team has in the
course of its speeches won all the applause only to be
bitterly disappointed in the end by hearing the decision
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>awarded to the other side. Recall the warnings given
in the previous chapters against the tempting fallacies
of appealing to crowd feelings and prejudices.</p>

<p>In classroom debates it is a good distribution of
responsibility to make all the members not participating
in the speaking act as judges and cast votes in
rendering a decision. This makes the judges and the
audience one. Moreover it changes the mere listener
into a discriminating judge. If the instructor cares
to carry this matter of responsibility one step farther,
he can ask the members of the class to explain and
justify their votes.</p>

<p>The audience, when it is also the judge, has the
responsibility of careful attention, analysis, and comparison.
It is too much to expect usual general audiences
to refuse to be moved by unworthy pleas and
misrepresentations, to accord approval only to the
best speakers and the soundest arguments. But surely
in a class of public speakers any such tricks and schemes
should be received with stolid frigidity. Nothing is
so damaging to appeals to prejudice, spread-eagleism,
and fustian bombast as an impassive reception.</p>

<p><b>The Judges.</b> In any debate the judges are of
supreme importance. They decide the merits of the
speakers themselves. The judges are of infinitely
more importance than the audience. In interscholastic
debates men of some prominence are invited to act as
judges. In the instructions to them it should be made
clear that they are not to decide which side of a proposition
they themselves approve. They are to decide
which group of speakers does the best work. They
should try to be merely the impersonal registers of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>comparative merit. They should sink their own feelings
as every teacher must when he hears a good speech
from one of his own students supporting something to
which the instructor is opposed. Good judges of debates
realize this and frequently award decisions to
speakers who support opposite positions to their personal
opinions. They must not be like the judges in
an interscholastic debate who announced their decision
thus, "The judges have decided that China must not
be dismembered." That was an interesting fact perhaps,
but it had nothing to do with their duty as judges
of that debate.</p>

<p>In business, the buyer, the head of the department,
the board of directors, constitute the judges who render
the decision. In legislative assemblies the audience
and judges are practically identical, for after the debate
upon a measure is concluded, those who have listened
to it render individual verdicts by casting their votes.
In such cases we frequently see decisions rendered
not upon the merits of the debate, but according to
class prejudice, personal opinion, or party lines. This
is why so many great argumentative speeches were
accounted failures at the time of their delivery. Delivered
to secure majority votes they failed to carry
conviction to the point of changing immediate action,
and so in the small temporary sense they were failures.
In legal trials the jury is the real judge, although by
our peculiar misapplication of the term a different
person entirely is called judge. In court the judge is
in reality more often merely the presiding officer. He
oversees the observance of all the rules of court practice,
keeps lawyers within the regulations, instructs the jury,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>receives the decision from them, and then applies the
law. Every lawyer speaks&mdash;not to convince the
judge&mdash;but to convince the jury to render a decision
in his favor.</p>

<p><b>Scholastic Debating. Choosing the Proposition.</b> In
school debating the proposition may be assigned by
the instructor or it may be chosen by him from a number
submitted by the class. The class itself may choose
by vote a proposition for debate. In interscholastic
debating the practice now usually followed is for one
school to submit the proposition and for the second
school to decide which side it prefers to support. In
any method the aim should be to give neither side any
advantage over the other. The speakers upon the
team may be selected before the question of debate is
known. It seems better, when possible, to make the
subject known first and then secure as speakers upon
both sides, students who have actual beliefs upon the
topic. Such personal conviction always results in
keener rivalry.</p>

<p><b>Time Limits.</b> Since no debate of this kind must last
too long, time restrictions must be agreed upon. In
every class, conditions will determine these terms.
Three or four speakers upon each side make a good
team. If each is allowed six minutes the debate
should come well within an hour and still allow some
time for voting upon the presentations. It should be
distinctly understood that a time limit upon a speaker
must be observed by him or be enforced by the presiding
officer.</p>

<p>The speakers upon one side will arrange among themselves
the order in which they will speak but there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>should be a clear understanding beforehand as to
whether rebuttal speeches are to be allowed.</p>

<p><b>Rebuttal Speeches.</b> Rebuttal speeches are additional
speeches allowed to some or all the speakers
of a debating team after the regular argumentative
speeches have been delivered. In an extended formal
debate all the speakers may thus appear a second time.
In less lengthy discussions only some of them may be
permitted to appear a second time. As the last speaker
has the advantage of making the final impression upon
the judges it is usual to offset this by reversing the order
of rebuttal. In the first speeches the negative always
delivers the last speech. Sometimes the first affirmative
speaker is allowed to follow with the single speech
in rebuttal. If the team consist of three speakers and
all are allowed to appear in rebuttal the entire order
is as follows.</p>

<table summary="Debating">
<tr><td ><i>First Part</i></td>
<td ><i>Rebuttal</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td >&nbsp;</td>
  <td >&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td >First affirmative</td><td >First negative</td></tr>
<tr><td >First negative</td><td >First affirmative</td></tr>
<tr><td >Second affirmative</td><td >Second negative</td></tr>
<tr><td >Second negative</td><td >Second affirmative</td></tr>
<tr><td >Third affirmative</td><td >Third negative</td></tr>
<tr><td >Third negative</td><td >Third affirmative</td></tr>
</table>



<p>If not all the speakers are to speak in rebuttal the
team itself decides which of its members shall speak for
all.</p>

<p><b>Preparation.</b> The proposition should be decided on
and the teams selected long enough in advance to allow
for adequate preparation. Every means should be employed
to secure sufficient material in effective arrange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>ment.
Once constituted, the team should consider
itself a unit. Work should be planned in conference and
distributed among the speakers. At frequent meetings
they should present to the side all they are able to find.
They should lay out a comprehensive plan of support
of their own side. They should anticipate the arguments
likely to be advanced by the other, and should
provide for disposing of them if they are important
enough to require refuting. It is a good rule for
every member of a debating team to know all the material
on his side, even though part of it is definitely
assigned to another speaker.</p>

<p>This preliminary planning should be upon a definite
method. A good outline to use, although some parts
may be discarded in the debate itself, is the following
simple one.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I. State the proposition clearly.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">1. Define the terms.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">2. Explain it as a whole.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">II. Give a history of the case.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">1. Show its present bearing or aspect.</span><br />
III. State the issues.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.0em;">IV. Prove.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">V. Refute.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.0em;">VI. Conclude.</span><br />
</p>

<p><b>Finding the Issues.</b> In debating, since time is so
valuable, a speaker must not wander afield. He must
use all his ability, all his material to prove his contention.
It will help him to reject material not relevant
if he knows exactly what is at issue between the two
sides. It was avoiding the issue to answer the charge
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>that Charles I was a tyrant by replying that he was a
good husband. Unless debaters realize exactly what
must be proven to make their position secure, there
will be really no debate, for the two sides will never
meet in a clash of opinion. They will pass each other
without meeting, and instead of a debate they will
present a series of argumentative speeches. This failure
to state issues clearly and to support or refute them
convincingly is one of the most common faults of all
debating. In ordinary conversation a frequently heard
criticism of a discussion or speech or article is "But
that was not the point at issue at all." These issues
must appear in the preliminary plans, in the finished
brief, and in the debate itself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The only point in issue between us is, how long after an
author's death the State shall recognize a copyright in his
representatives and assigns; and it can, I think, hardly be
disputed by any rational man that this is a point which the
legislature is free to determine in the way which may appear
to be most conducive to the general good.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Thomas Babington Macaulay</span>: <i>Copyright</i>, 1841</p>

<p>Mr. President, the very first question that challenges our
attention in the matter of a league of nations is the question
of whether a war in Europe is a matter of concern to the
United States. The ultraopponents of any league of nations
assert that European quarrels and European battles are
no concern of ours. If that be true, we may well pause before
obligating ourselves to make them our concern. Is it true?</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Senator P.J. McCumber</span>: <i>The League of Nations</i>, 1919</p>
</div>

<p>The best method of finding the issues is to put down
in two columns the main contentions of both sides.
By eliminating those entries which are least important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>and those which have least bearing upon the present
case the issues may be reduced to those which the
debate should cover. Any possible attempt to cloud
the issues on the part of the opposing side can thus be
forestalled. All the speakers on one side should participate
in this analysis of the proposition to find and
state the issues.</p>

out these chief points of difference between the Paris
plan and Senator Knox's for the League of Nations.</p>

<p><b>Team Work.</b> With the plan agreed upon by the
speakers, the brief made out, and the material distributed,
each speaker can go to work in earnest to
prepare his single speech. The best method has been
outlined in this book. His notes should be accurate,
clear, easily manipulated. His quotations should be
exact, authoritative. By no means should he memorize
his speech. Such stilted delivery would result
in a series of formal declamations. With his mind
stocked with exactly what his particular speech is to
cover, yet familiar enough with the material of his
colleagues to use it should he need it, the debater is
ready for the contest.</p>

<p><b>Manipulating Material.</b> The speakers on a side
should keep all their material according to some system.
If cards are used, arguments to be used in the
main debate might be arranged in one place, material
for rebuttal in another, quotations and statistics in
still another. Then if the other side introduces a
point not anticipated it should be easy to find the
refuting or explaining material at once to counteract
its influence in the next speech, if it should be disposed
of at once. If slips of paper are used, different colors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>might indicate different kinds of material. Books,
papers, reports, to be used should always be within
available distance. While a speaker for the other side
is advancing arguments the speaker who will follow
him should be able to change, if necessary, his entire
plan of defense or attack to meet the man&oelig;uver. He
should select from the various divisions upon the table
the material he needs, and launch at once into a speech
which meets squarely all the contentions advanced by
his predecessor. This instantaneous commandeering
of material is likely to be most usual in rebuttal, but
a good debater must be able to resort to it at a second's
notice.</p>

<p><b>The First Affirmative Speaker.</b> The first affirmative
speaker must deliver some kind of introduction to
the contentions which his side intends to advance. It
is his duty to be concise and clear in this. He must
not use too much time. If the proposition needs defining
and applying he must not fail to do it. He must
not give the negative the opportunity to explain and
apply to its own purposes the meaning of the proposition.
He should state in language which the hearers
will remember exactly what the issues are. He can
help his own side by outlining exactly what the affirmative
intends to prove. He may indicate just what
portions will be treated by his colleagues. He should
never stop with merely introducing and outlining.
Every speaker must advance proof, the first as well as
the others. If the preliminary statements by the first
affirmative speaker are clearly and convincingly delivered,
and if he places a few strong, supporting reasons
before the judges, he will have started his side very well
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>upon its course of debating. The last sentences of
his speech should drive home the points he has proved.</p>

<p><b>The First Negative Speaker.</b> The first negative
speaker either agrees with the definitions and application
of the proposition as announced by the first affirmative
speaker or he disagrees with them. If the latter,
the mere statement of his disagreement is not sufficient.
Contradiction is not proof. He must refute the definition
and application of the proposition by strong
reasoning and ample proof. If his side does not admit
the issues as already presented he must explain or
prove them away and establish in their place the
issues his side sees in the discussion. When the two
sides disagree concerning the issues there is a second
proposition erected for discussion at once and the
argument upon this second matter may crowd out the
attempted argument upon the main proposition. To
obviate such shifting many schools have the sides
exchange briefs or statements of issues before the debate
so that some agreement will be reached upon essentials.</p>

<p>In addition to the matters just enumerated the first
negative speaker should outline the plan his side will
follow, promising exactly what things will be established
by his colleagues. If he feels that the first
affirmative speaker has advanced proofs strong enough
to require instant refutation he should be able to meet
those points at once and dispose of them. If they do
not require immediate answering, or if they may safely
be left for later refutation in the regular rebuttal, he
may content himself with simply announcing that
they will be answered. He should not allow the
audience to believe that his side cannot meet them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<p>He must not give the impression that he is evading
them. If he has to admit their truth, let him frankly
say so, showing, if possible, how they do not apply or
do not prove all that is claimed for them, or that though
they seem strong in support of the affirmative the
negative side has still stronger arguments which by
comparison refute at least their effect.</p>

<p>The first negative speaker should not stop with mere
refutation. If the first affirmative has advanced proofs,
and the first negative disposes of them, the debate is
exactly where it was at the beginning. The negative
speaker must add convincing arguments of his own. It
is a good thing to start with one of the strongest
negative arguments in the material.</p>

<p><b>The Second Affirmative and Second Negative
Speakers.</b> The second affirmative and the second
negative speakers have very much the same kind of
speech to make. Taking the immediate cues from
the preceding speaker each may at first pay some
attention to the remarks of his opponent. Here again
there must be quickly decided the question already
brought up by the first negative speech&mdash;shall arguments
be refuted at once or reserved for such treatment
in rebuttal? When this decision is made the next
duty of each of these second speakers is to advance
his side according to the plan laid down by his first
colleague. He must make good the advance notice
given of his team.</p>

<p>Each position of a debater has its peculiar tasks.
The middle speaker must not allow the interest aroused
by the first to lag. If anything, his material and
manner must indicate a rise over the opening speech.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<p>He must start at the place where the first speaker
stopped and carry on the contention to the place at
which it has been agreed he will deliver it to the concluding
speaker for his side. If this connection among
all the speeches of one side is quite plain to the audience
an impression of unity and coherence will be made
upon them. This will contribute to the effect of cogent
reasoning. They will realize that instead of listening
to a group of detached utterances they have been following
a chain of reasoning every link of which is
closely connected with all that precedes and follows.</p>

<p><b>The Concluding Affirmative Speaker.</b> The concluding
affirmative speaker must not devote his entire
speech to a conclusion by giving an extensive summary
or recapitulation. He must present arguments.
Realizing that this is the last chance for original argument
from his side he may be assigned the very strongest
argument of all to deliver, for the effect of what he
says must last beyond the concluding speech of the
negative. It would likewise be a mistake for him to
do nothing more than argue in his concluding speech.
Several persons have intervened since his first colleague
outlined their side and announced what they
would prove. It is his duty to show that the affirmative
has actually done what it set out to do. By
amplifying and diminishing he may also show how
the negative had not carried out its avowed intention
of disproving the affirmative's position and proving
conclusively its own. The concluding speech for the
affirmative is an excellent test of a debater's ability to
adapt himself to conditions which may have been
entirely unforeseen when the debate began, of his keen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>ness
in analyzing the strength of the affirmative and
exposing the weakness of the negative, of his power in
impressing the arguments of his colleagues as well as
his own upon the audience, and of his skill in bringing
to a well-rounded, impressive conclusion his side's
part in the debate.</p>

<p><b>The Concluding Negative Speaker.</b> The concluding
negative speaker must judge whether his immediate
predecessor, the concluding affirmative speaker, has
been able to gain the verdict of the judges. If he fears
that he has, he must strive to argue that conviction
away. He too must advance proof finally to strengthen
the negative side. He must make his speech answer
to his first colleague's announced scheme, or if some
change in the line of development has been necessitated,
he must make clear why the first was replaced by the
one the debaters have followed. If the arguments of
the negative have proved what it was declared they
would, the last speaker should emphasize that fact
beyond any question in any one's mind. Finally he
should save time for a fitting conclusion. This brings
the debate proper to a close.</p>

<p><b>Restrictions in Rebuttal.</b> In rebuttal&mdash;if it be
provided&mdash;the main restrictions are two. The speeches
are shorter than the earlier ones. No new lines of
argument may be introduced. Only lines of proof
already brought forward may be considered. Since
the speeches are shorter and the material is restricted
there is always the disposition to use rebuttal speeches
for refutation only. This is a mistake. Refute, but
remember always that constructive argument is more
likely to win decisions than destructive. Dispose of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>as many points of the opponents as possible, but
reiterate the supporting reasons of your own. Many
speakers waste their rebuttals by trying to cover too
many points. They therefore have insufficient time
to prove anything, so they fall back upon bare contradiction
and assertion. Such presentations are mere
jumbles of statements. Choose a few important phases
of the opposing side's contention. Refute them.
Choose the telling aspects of your own case. Emphasize
them.</p>

<p><b>Manner in Debating.</b> Be as earnest and convincing
in your speeches as you can. Never yield to the
temptation to indulge in personalities. Recall that
other speakers should never be mentioned by name.
They are identified by their order and their side, as
"The first speaker on the affirmative" or "The
speaker who preceded me," or "My colleague," or
"My opponent." Avoid using these with tones and
phrases of sarcasm and bitterness. Be fair and courteous
in every way. Never indulge in such belittling
expressions as "No one understands what he is trying
to prove. He reels off a string of figures which mean
nothing." Never indulge in cheap wit or attempts
at satiric humor.</p>

<p>Prepare so adequately, analyze so keenly, argue so
logically, speak so convincingly, that even when your
side loses, your opponents will have to admit that you
forced them to do better than they had any idea they
could.</p>

<h3>SPEAKING UPON SPECIAL OCCASIONS</h3>


<p><b>Speech-making in the Professions.</b> If a student
enter a profession in which speech-making is the regular
means of gaining his livelihood&mdash;as in law, religion,
or lecturing&mdash;he will find it necessary to secure training
in the technical methods applying to the particular
kind of speech-making in which he will indulge. This
book does not attempt to prepare any one for mastery
of such special forms. The student will, however, be
helping himself if he examines critically every delivery
of a legal argument, sermon, or lecture he hears,
for many of the rules illustrated by them and
the impressions made by their speakers, can be transferred
as models to be imitated or specimens to be
avoided in his own more restricted and less important
world.</p>

<p><b>Speaking upon Special Occasions.</b> Every American
may be called upon to speak upon some special occasion.
If he does well at his first appearance he may be invited
or required by circumstances to speak upon many
occasions. The person who can interest audiences by
effective delivery of suitable material fittingly adapted
to the particular occasion is always in demand. Within
the narrower confines of educational institutions the
opportunities for the student to appear before his
schoolmates are as numerous as in real life. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>preliminary knowledge coupled with much practice will
produce deep satisfaction upon successful achievement
and result in rapid steps of self-development.</p>

<p>Without pretending to provide for all possible circumstances
in which students and others may be called
upon to speak, this chapter will list some of the special
occasions for which speeches should be prepared.</p>

<p><b>Speeches of Presiding Officers.</b> On practically all
occasions there is a presiding officer whose chief duty
is to introduce to the audience the various speakers.
The one great fault of speeches of introduction is that
they are too long. The introducer sincerely means
not to consume too much time, but in the endeavor
to do justice to the occasion or the speaker he becomes
involved in his remarks until they wander far from
his definite purpose. He wearies the audience before
the important speaker begins. An introducer should
not become so unconscious of his real task as to fall
into this error. In other cases the fault is not so innocent.
Many a person called upon to introduce a
speaker takes advantage of the chance to express his
own opinions. He drops into the discourtesy of using
for his own ends a condition of passive attention which
was not created for him. One large audience which
had assembled to hear a lecturer was kept from listening
to him while for twenty minutes the introducer
aired his own pet theories. Of course members of the
audience discussed among themselves the inappropriateness
of such remarks, but it is doubtful whether
any criticism reached the offender.</p>

<p>A newspaper recently had the courage to voice the
feelings of audiences.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It seems that a good deal of the time of the audience at
the Coliseum the other night was taken by those who introduced
the speakers of the evening. We are told in one account
of the meeting that the audience was at times impatient
of these preliminaries and even howled once or twice
for those it had come to hear.... We are informed that
all those introducing the speakers said something about
not having risen to speak at length, and that one of them
protested his inability to speak with any facility. Both these
professions are characteristic of those introducing speakers
of the evening. Yet, strangely enough, the same always
happens. That is, the preliminaries wear the audience out
before the people it came to hear can get at it.</p></div>

<p>In introducing a speaker never be too long-winded.
Tactfully, gracefully, courteously, put before the audience
such facts as the occasion, the reason for the topic
of the speech, the fitness and appropriateness of the
choice of the speaker, then present the man or woman.
Be extremely careful of facts and names. A nominating
speaker at a great political convention ruined the
effect of a speech by confusedly giving several first
names to a distinguished man. It is embarrassing to a
speaker to have to correct at the very beginning of his
remarks a misstatement made by the presiding officer.
But a man from one university cannot allow the audience
to identify him with another. The author of a
book wants its title correctly given. A public official
desires to be associated in people's minds with the department
he actually controls.</p>

<p>The main purpose of a speech of introduction is to
do for the succeeding speaker what the chapter on
beginning the speech suggested&mdash;to render the audi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>ence
attentive and well-disposed, to introduce the
topic, and in addition to present the speaker.</p>

<p><b>Choosing a Theme.</b> The speaker at a special occasion
must choose the theme with due regard to the
subject and the occasion. Frequently his theme will
be suggested to him, so that it will already bear a close
relation to the occasion when he begins its preparation.
The next matter he must consider with extreme care
is the treatment. Shall it be serious, informative, argumentative,
humorous, scoffing, ironic? To decide
this he must weigh carefully the significance of the occasion.
Selecting the inappropriate manner of treatment
means risking the success of the speech. Recall
how many men and speeches you have heard criticized
as being "out of harmony with the meeting," or "not
in spirit with the proceedings," and you will realize
how necessary to the successful presentation is this
delicate adjustment of the speech to the mood of the
circumstances.</p>

<p><b>The After-dinner Speech.</b> When men and women
have met to partake of good food under charming surroundings
and have enjoyed legitimate gastronomic
delights it is regrettable that a disagreeable element
should be added by a series of dull, long-winded, un-appropriate
after-dinner speeches. The preceding adjectives
suggest the chief faults of those persons who
are repeatedly asked to speak upon such occasions.
They so often miss the mark. Because after-dinner
speaking is so informal it is proportionally difficult.
When called upon, a person feels that he must acknowledge
the compliment by saying something. This,
however, is not really enough. He must choose his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>theme and style of treatment from the occasion. If
the toastmaster assign the topic he is safe so far as
that is concerned, but he must still be careful of his
treatment.</p>

<p>A speaker at a dinner of the Phi Beta Kappa Society,
in which membership is awarded for rank in cultural
as contrasted with practical, technical studies, seized
upon the chance to deliver a rather long, quite detailed
legal explanation of the parole system for convicted
offenders against laws. At a dinner given by the
Pennsylvania Society in a state far from their original
homes the members were praised to the skies for
preserving the love of their native state and marking
their identity in a district so distant and different.
This was quite appropriate for an introduction but
the speaker then turned abruptly to one of his political
speeches and berated the foreigner in America for not
becoming at once an entirely made-over citizen. The
speech contradicted its own sentiments. A wrong
emphasis was placed upon its material. A disquieting
impression was made upon the Pennsylvanians. At
the conclusion they felt that they were guilty for having
kept the love of their native soil; according to the tone
of the speaker they should have accepted their new
residence and wiped out all traces of any early ties.</p>

<p>An after-dinner speaker should remember that
dinners are usually marks of sociability, goodfellowship,
congratulation, celebration, commemoration.
Speeches should answer to such motives. The apt
illustration, the clever twist, the really good story or
anecdote, the surprise ending, all have their places
here, if they are used with grace, good humor, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>tact. This does not preclude elements of information
and seriousness, but such matters should be introduced
skilfully, discussed sparingly, enforced pointedly.</p>

<p><b>The Commemorative Speech.</b> Besides dinners,
other gatherings may require commemorative addresses.
These speeches are longer, more formal.
The success of a debating team, the successful season of
an athletic organization, the termination of a civic
project, the election of a candidate, the celebration of
an historic event, the tribute to a great man, suggest
the kinds of occasions in which commemorative addresses
should be made.</p>

<p>Chosen with more care than the after-dinner speaker,
the person on such an occasion has larger themes with
which to deal, a longer time for their development, and
an audience more surely attuned to sympathetic reception.
He has more time for preparation also. In
minor circumstances, such as the first three or four
enumerated in the preceding paragraph, the note is
usually congratulation for victory. Except in tone
and length these speeches are not very different from
after-dinner remarks. But when the occasion is more
dignified, the circumstances more significant, addresses
take on a different aspect. They become more soberly
judicial, more temperately laudatory, more feelingly
impressive. At such times public speaking approaches
most closely to the old-fashioned idea of oratory, now
so rapidly passing away, in its attempt to impress upon
the audience the greatness of the occasion in which it
is participating. The laying of a corner-stone, the
completion of a monument or building, a national
holiday, the birthday of a great man, the date of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>epoch-marking event, bring forth eulogistic tributes like
Webster's speech at Bunker Hill, Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address, Secretary Lane's Flag Day speech.</p>

<p><b>False Eloquence.</b> The beginner will not have many
opportunities of delivering such remarkable addresses,
but in his small sphere he will have chances to do
similar things. He must beware of several faults of
which the unwary are usually guilty. Recognizing the
wonderful eloquence of the masterpieces of such kinds
of address he may want to reproduce its effects by imitating
its apparent methods. Nothing could be worse.
The style of the great eulogy, born of the occasion and
the speaker, becomes only exaggerated bombast and
nonsense from the lips of a student. Exaggeration,
high sounding terms, flowery language, involved constructions,
do not produce eloquence in the speaker.
They produce discomfort, often smiles of ridicule, in
the audience. Many a student intending to cover
himself with glory by eulogizing the martyred McKinley
or the dead Roosevelt has succeeded only in
covering himself with derision. Simplicity, straightforwardness,
fair statement, should be the aims of
beginning speakers upon such occasions.</p>

<p><b>Speeches of Presentation and Acceptance.</b> Standing
between the two classes of speeches just discussed are
speeches of presentation and acceptance. In practically
all circumstances where such remarks are suitable
there are present mingled feelings of celebration
and commemoration. There is joy over something accomplished,
and remembrance of merit or success. So
the person making a speech of presentation must
mingle the two feelings as he and the audience ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>perience
them. Taking his cue from the tone of the
occasion he must fit his remarks to that mood. He
may be as bright and sparkling and as amusing as a
refined court jester. He may be as impressive and
serious as a judge. The treatment must be determined
by the circumstances.</p>

<p>The speaker who replies must take his cue from the
presenter. While the first has the advantage of carrying
out his plan as prepared, the second can only dimly
anticipate the theme he will express. At any rate he
cannot so surely provide his beginning. That must
come spontaneously from the turn given the material
by his predecessor, although the recipient may pass
by a transition to the remarks he prepared in advance.</p>

<p>The observations which obtain in the presentation
and acceptance of a material object&mdash;as a book, a
silver tea set, a medal, an art gallery&mdash;apply just as
well to the bestowal and acceptance of an honor, such
as a degree from a university, an office, an appointment
as head of a committee or as foreign representative,
or membership in a society. Speeches upon such occasions
are likely to be more formal than those delivered
upon the transfer of a gift. The bestower may cite the
reasons for the honor, the fitness of the recipient, the
mutual honors and obligations, and conclude with
hopes of further attainments or services. The recipient
may reply from a personal angle, explaining not only
his appreciation, but his sense of obligation to a trust
or duty, his methods of fulfilling his responsibilities, his
modestly phrased hope or belief in his ultimate success.</p>

<p><b>The Inaugural Speech.</b> In this last-named respect
the speech of the recipient of an honor is closely related
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>to the speech of a person inaugurated to office. This
applies to all official positions to which persons are
elected or appointed. The examples which will spring
into students' minds are the inaugural speeches of
Presidents of the United States. A study of these will
furnish hints for the newly installed incumbent of more
humble positions. In material they are likely to be
retrospective and anticipatory. They trace past causes
up to present effects, then pass on to discuss future
plans and methods. Every officer in his official capacity
has something to do. Newspaper articles will
give you ideas of what officials should be doing. The
office holder at the beginning of his term should make
clear to his constituency, his organization, his class, his
society, his school, just what he intends to try to do.
He must be careful not to antagonize possible supporters
by antagonistic remarks or opinions. He
should try to show reason and expediency in all he urges.
He should temper satisfaction and triumph with
seriousness and resolve. Facts and arguments will be
of more consequence than opinions and promises. The
speech should be carefully planned in advance, clearly
expressed, plainly delivered. Its statements should be
weighed, as everyone of them may be used later as
reasons for support or attack. To avoid such consequences
the careful politician often indulges in glittering
generalities which mean nothing. A student in such
conditions should face issues squarely, and without
stirring up unnecessary antagonism, announce his
principles clearly and firmly. If he has changed his
opinion upon any subject he may just as well state his
position so that no misunderstanding may arise later.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>In the exercise of his regular activities a person will
have many opportunities to deliver this kind of speech.</p>

<p><b>The Nominating Speech.</b> Recommendation of himself
by a candidate for office does not fall within the
plan of this book. Students, however, may indulge in
canvassing votes for their favorite candidates, and this
in some instances, leads to public speaking in class and
mass meetings, assemblies, and the like. Of similar
import is the nominating speech in which a member of
a society, committee, meeting, offers the name of his
candidate for the votes of as many as will indorse him.
In nominating, it is a usual trick of arrangement to
give first all the qualifications of the person whose
election is to be urged, advancing all reasons possible
for the choice, and uttering his name only in the very
last words of the nominating speech. This plan works
up to a cumulative effect which should deeply impress
the hearers at the mention of the candidate's name.</p>

<p>In nominating speeches and in arguments supporting
a candidate the deliverer should remember two things.
Constructive proof is better than destructive attack;
assertion of opinion and personal preference is not proof.
If it seems necessary at times to show the fitness of one
candidate by contrast with another, never descend to
personalities, never inject a tone of personal attack, of
cheap wit, of ill-natured abuse. If such practices are
resorted to by others, answer or disregard them with
the courteous attention they deserve, no more. Do
not allow yourself to be drawn into any discussion
remote from the main issue&mdash;the qualifications of your
own candidate. If you speak frequently upon such a
theme&mdash;as you may during an extended campaign&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>notice
which of your arguments make the strongest
impressions upon the hearers. Discard the weaker
ones to place more and more emphasis upon the convincing
reasons. Never fail to study other speakers
engaged in similar attempts. American life every day
provides you with illustrations to study.</p>

<p><b>The Speech in Support of a Measure.</b> When, instead
of a candidate, you are supporting some measure
to be adopted, some reform to be instituted, some
change to be inaugurated, your task is easier in one
respect. There will be less temptation to indulge in
personal matters. You will find it easier to adhere to
your theme. In such attempts to mold public opinion&mdash;whether
it be the collective opinion of a small
school class, or a million voters&mdash;you will find opportunities
for the inclusion of everything you know of
the particular subject and of all human nature. Convinced
yourself of the worthiness of your cause, bend
every mental and intellectual effort to making others understand
as you do, see as you do. If your reasoning is
clear and converting, if your manner is direct and sincere,
you should be able to induce others to believe as you do.</p>

<p><b>The Persuasive Speech.</b> In public speaking upon
occasions when votes are to be cast, where reforms are
to be instituted, where changes are to be inaugurated,
you have not finished when you have turned the mental
attitude, and done no more. You must arouse the will
to act. Votes must be cast for the measure you approve.
The reform you urge must be financed at once.
The change must be registered. To accomplish such
a purpose you must do more than merely prove; you
must persuade.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>In the use of his power over people to induce them to
noble, high-minded action lies the supreme importance
of the public speaker.</p>

<h3>DRAMATICS</h3>


<p><b>Difference between Public Speaking and Acting.</b> In
practically all the aspects of public speaking you
deliver your own thoughts in your own words. In
dramatic presentation you deliver the words already
written by some one else; and in addition, while you are
delivering these remarks you speak as though you were
no longer yourself, but a totally different person. This
is the chief distinction between speaking in public and
acting. While you must memorize the lines you deliver
when you try to act like a character other than yourself,
speeches in dramatic production are not like usual
memorized selections. Usually a memorized selection
does not express the feelings or opinions of a certain
character, but is likely to be descriptive or narrative.
Both prose and verse passages contain more than the
uttered words of a single person.</p>

<p>As preparation for exercise in dramatics, whether
simple or elaborate, training in memorizing and practice
in speaking are extremely valuable. Memorizing may
make the material grow so familiar that it loses its
interest for the speaker. Pupils frequently recite committed
material so listlessly that they merely bore
hearers. Such a disposition to monotony should be
neutralized by the ability to speak well in public.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Naturalness and Sincerity.</b> When you speak lines
from a play inject as much naturalness and sincerity
into your delivery as you can command. Speak the
words as though they really express your own ideas and
feelings. If you feel that you must exaggerate slightly
because of the impression the remark is intended to
make, rely more upon emphasis than upon any other
device to secure an effect. Never slip into an affected
manner of delivering any speech. No matter what
kind of acting you have seen upon amateur or professional
stage, you must remember that moderation
is the first essential of the best acting. Recall what
Shakespeare had Hamlet say to the players.</p>

<p>Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus:
but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and,
as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire
and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh,
it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious, periwig-pated
fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to
split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part
are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows and
noise.</p>

<p><b>Character Delineation.</b> In taking part in a play
you must do more than simply recite words spoken by
some one other than yourself. You must really act
like that person. This adds to the simple delivery of
speeches all those other traits by which persons in real
life are different from one another. Such complete
identification of your personality with that of the person
you are trying to represent in a play is termed character
delineation, or characterization.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>You may believe that you cannot represent an
Indian chief or a British queen, or an Egyptian slave,
or a secret service agent, but if you will recall your
childish pastime of day-dreaming you will see at once
that you have quite frequently identified yourself with
some one else, and in that other character you have
made yourself experience the strangest and most thrilling
adventures. When you study a r&ocirc;le in a scene or
play, use your imagination in that same manner. In
a short time it will be easy for you to think as that other
character would. Then you have become identified
with him. The first step in your delineation has been
taken.</p>

<p>Visualize in your mind's eye&mdash;your imagination&mdash;the
circumstances in which that character is placed in
the play. See yourself looking, moving, acting as he
would. Then talk as that character would in those
circumstances. Make him react as he would naturally
in the situations in which the dramatist has placed him.</p>

<p>Let us try to make this more definite. Suppose a
boy is chosen to act the part of an old man. An old
man does not speak as rapidly as a boy does. He will
have to change the speed of his speech. But suppose
the old man is moved to wrath, would his words come
slowly? Would he speak distinctly or would he almost
choke?</p>

<p>The girl who is delineating a foreign woman must
picture her accent and hesitation in speaking English.
She would give to her face the rather vacant questioning
look such a woman would have as the English speech
flits about her, too quickly for her to comprehend all
of it.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl who tries to present a British queen in a
Shakespeare play must not act as a pupil does in the
school corridor. Yet if that queen is stricken in her
feelings as a mother, might not all the royal dignity
melt away, and her Majesty act like any sorrowing
woman?</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>You are sitting at a table or desk. The telephone rings.
You pick up the receiver. A person at the other end invites
you to dinner. Deliver your part of the conversation.</p>
<div style="margin-left:2em; ">
<p>1. Speak in your own character.</p>

<p>2. Speak as a busy, quick-tempered old man in his
disordered office.</p>

<p>3. Speak as a tired wife who hasn't had a relief for
weeks from the drudgery of house-work.</p>

<p>4. Speak as a young debutante who has been entertained
every day for weeks.</p>

<p>5. Speak as the office boy.</p>

<p>6. Speak as an over-polite foreigner.</p>

<p>7. Delineate some other kind of person.</p>
</div>
<p>Improvisations are here given first because such
exercises depend upon the pupil's original interpretation
of a character. The pupil is required to do so much
clear thinking about the character he represents that
he really creates it.</p>

<p><b>Dialogues</b>. As it is easier to get two people to
speak naturally than where more are involved we shall
begin conversation with dialogues. Each character
will find the lines springing spontaneously from the
situation. In dramatic composition any speech delivered
by a character is called a line, no matter how
short or long it is.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>As you deliver the dialogues suggested by the exercises
try to make your speeches sound natural. Talk
as real people talk. Make the remarks conversational,
or colloquial, as this style is also termed. What things
will make conversation realistic? In actual talk,
people anticipate. Speakers do not wait for others to
finish. They interrupt. They indicate opinions and
impressions by facial expression and slight bodily movements.
Tone changes as feelings change.</p>

<p>Try to make your remarks convey to the audience
the circumstances surrounding the dialogue. Let the
conversation make some point clear. Before you begin,
determine in your own mind the characterization you
intend to present.</p>

<p>Situation. A girl buys some fruit from the keeper of
a stand at a street corner.</p>

<p>What kind of girl? Age? Manner of speaking?
Courteous? Flippant? Well-bred? Slangy? Working
girl? Visitor to town?</p>

<p>What kind of man? Age? American? Foreigner?
From what country? Dialect? Disposition? Suspicious?
Sympathetic?</p>

<p>Weather? Season of year? Do they talk about
that? About themselves? Does the heat make her
long for her home in the country? Does the cold make
him think of his native Italy or Greece? Will her
remarks change his short, gruff answers to interested
questions about her home? Will his enthusiasm for
his native land change her flippancy to interest in far-off
romantic countries? How would the last detail impress
the change, if you decide to have one? Might he
call her back and force her to take a gift? Might she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>deliver an impressive phrase, then dash away as though
startled by her exhibition of sympathetic feeling?</p>

<p>These are mere suggestions. Two pupils might
present the scene as indicated by these questions.
Two others might show it as broadly comic, and end
by having the girl&mdash;at a safe distance&mdash;triumphantly
show that she had stolen a second fruit. That might
give him the cue to end in a tirade of almost inarticulate
abuse, or he might stand in silence, expressing by his
face the emotions surging over him. And his feeling
need not be entirely anger, either. It might border on
admiration for her amazing audacity, or pathetic helplessness,
or comic despair, or determination to "get
even" next time.</p>

<p>Before you attempt to present any of the following
suggestive exercises you should consider every possibility
carefully and decide definitely and consistently
all the questions that may arise concerning every detail.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Let a boy come into the room and try to induce a girl
(the mistress of a house) to have a telephone installed. Make
the dialogue realistic and interesting.</p>

<p>2. Let a girl demonstrate a vacuum cleaner (or some other
appliance) to another girl (mistress of a house).</p>

<p>3. Let a boy apply for a position to a man in an office.</p>

<p>4. Let a boy dictate a letter to a gum-chewing, fidgety,
harum-scarum stenographer.</p>

<p>5. Let this stenographer tell the telephone girl about this.</p>

<p>6. Show how a younger sister might talk at a baseball or
football game to her slightly older brother who was coerced
into bringing her with him.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Show a fastidious woman at a dress goods counter, and
the tired, but courteous clerk. Do not caricature, but try
to give an air of reality to this.</p>

<p>8. Show how two young friends who have not seen each
other for weeks might talk when they meet again.</p>

<p>9. Deliver the thoughts of a pupil at eleven o'clock at
night trying to choose the topic for an English composition
due the next morning. Have him talk to his mother, or
father, or older brother, or sister.</p>

<p>10. A foreign woman speaking and understanding little
English, with a ticket to Springfield, has by mistake boarded
a through train which does not stop there. The conductor,
a man, and woman try to explain to her what she must do.</p>

<p>11. Let three different pairs of pupils represent the girl
and the fruit seller cited in the paragraphs preceding these
exercises.</p>

<p>12. A young man takes a girl riding in a new automobile.
Reproduce parts of the ride.</p>

<p>13. Two graduates of your school meet after many years
in a distant place. Reproduce their reminiscenses.</p>

<p>14. A woman in a car or coach has lost or misplaced her
transfer or ticket. Give the conversation between her and
the conductor.</p>

<p>15. Let various pairs of pupils reproduce the conversations
of patrons of moving pictures.</p>

<p>16. Suggest other characters in appropriate situations.
Present them before the class.</p>

<p><b>Characters Conceived by Others.</b> In all the preceding
exercises you have been quite unrestricted in
your interpretation. You have been able to make up
entirely the character you presented. Except for a few
stated details of sex, age, occupation, nature, no suggestions
were given of the person indicated. Delinea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>tion
is fairly easy to construct when you are given such
a free choice of all possibilities. The next kind of
exercise will involve a restriction to make the acting
a little more like the acting of a r&ocirc;le in a regular play.
Even here, however, a great deal is left to the pupil's
thought and decision.</p>

<p>How much chance there may be for such individual
thought and decision in a finished play written by a
careful dramatist may be illustrated by <i>Fame and the
Poet</i> by Lord Dunsany. One of the characters is a
Lieutenant-Major who calls upon a poet in London.
Nothing is said about his costume. In one city an
actor asked the British consul. He said officers of the
army do not wear their uniforms except when in active
service, but on the British stage one great actor had
by his example created the convention of wearing the
uniform. In another city at exactly the same time the
author himself was asked the same question. He said
that by no means should the actor wear a uniform.</p>

<p>In the next exercises you are to represent characters
with whom you have become acquainted in books.
You will therefore know something about their dispositions,
their appearance, and their actions. Your
task will be to give life-like portraits which others will
recognize as true to their opinions of these same people.
For all who have read the books the general outlines
will be identical. The added details must not contradict
any of the traits depicted by the authors. Otherwise
they may be as original as you can imagine.</p>

<p>In the <i>Odyssey</i>, the great old Greek poem by Homer,
the wandering hero, Odysseus (also called Ulysses), is
cast up by the sea upon a strange shore. Here he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>meets Nausicaa (pronounced Nau-si'-ca-a) who offers
to show him the way to the palace of her father, the
Bang. But as she is betrothed she fears that if she is
seen in the company of an unknown man some scandalous
gossip may be carried to her sweetheart. So she
directs that when they near the town Odysseus shall
tarry behind, allowing her to enter alone. In this naive
incident this much is told in detail by the poet. We
are not told whether any gossip does reach the lover's
ears. He does not appear in the story. We are not
told even his name. Nor are we told how either she
or he behaved when they first met, after she had
conducted the stranger to the palace.</p>

<p>If you enact this scene of their meeting you will first
have to find a name for him. You are free to create
all the details of their behavior and conversation. Was
he angry? Was he cool towards her? Had he heard
a false account?</p>

<p>Before attempting any of the following exercises
decide all the matters of interpretation as already
indicated in this chapter.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Molly Farren tries to get news of Godfrey Cass from a
Stable-boy. <i>Silas Marner</i>.</p>

<p>2. The two Miss Gunns talk about Priscilla Lammeter.

<p>4. Nausicaa tells her betrothed about Odysseus. <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p>5. Reynaldo in Paris tries to get information about
Laertes. <i>Hamlet</i>.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Fred tells his wife about Scrooge and Crachit. <i>A
Christmas Carol</i>.</p>

<p>7. Jupiter tells a friend of the finding of the treasure.
<i>The Gold Bug</i>.</p>

<p>8. Two women who know David Copperfield talk about
his second marriage. <i>David Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p><b>Memorized Conversations.</b> You can approach still
more closely to the material of a play if you offer in
speech before your class certain suitable portions from
books you are reading or have read. These selections
may be made from the regular class texts or from supplementary
reading assignments. In studying these
passages with the intention of offering them before the
class you will have to think about two things. First
of all, the author has in all probability, somewhere in
the book, given a fairly detailed, exact description of
the looks and actions of these characters. If such a
description does not occur in an extended passage, there
is likely to be a series of statements scattered about,
from which a reader builds up an idea of what the
character is like. The pupil who intends to represent a
person from a book or poem must study the author's
picture to be able to reproduce a convincing portrait.</p>

<p>The audience will pass over mere physical differences.
A young girl described in a story as having blue eyes
may be acted by a girl with brown, and be accepted.
But if the author states that under every kind remark
she made there lurked a slight hint of envy, that difficult
suggestion to put into a tone must be striven for, or
the audience will not receive an adequate impression of
the girl's disposition.</p>

<p>So, too, in male characters. A boy who plays old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>Scrooge in <i>A Christmas Carol</i> may not be able to look
like him physically, but in the early scenes he must
let no touch of sympathy or kindness creep into his
voice or manner.</p>

<p>It is just this inability or carelessness in plays attempting
to reproduce literary works upon the stage
that annoys so many intelligent, well-read people who
attend theatrical productions of material which they
already know. When <i>Vanity Fair</i> was dramatised
and acted as <i>Becky Sharp</i>, the general comment was
that the characters did not seem like Thackeray's
creations. This was even more apparent when <i>Pendennis</i>
was staged.</p>

<p>If you analyze and study characters in a book from this
point of view you will find them becoming quite alive to
your imagination. You will get to know them personally.
As you vizualize them in your imagination they
will move about as real people do. Thus your reading
will take on a new aspect of reality which will fix forever
in your mind all you glance over upon the printed page.</p>

<p><b>Climax.</b> The second thing to regard in choosing
passages from books to present before the class is that
the lines shall have some point. Conversation in a
story is introduced for three different purposes. It
illustrates character. It exposes some event of the plot.
It merely entertains. Such conversation as this last
is not good material for dramatic delivery. It is hardly
more than space filling. The other two kinds are generally
excellent in providing the necessary point to
which dramatic structure always rises. You have
heard it called a climax. So then you should select
from books passages which provide climaxes.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>One dictionary defines climax: "the highest point
of intensity, development, etc.; the culmination; acme;
as, he was then at the climax of his fortunes." In a
play it is that turning-point towards which all events
have been leading, and from which all following events
spring. Many people believe that all climaxes are
points of great excitement and noise. This is not so.
Countless turning-points in stirring and terrible times
have been in moments of silence and calm. Around
them may have been intense suspense, grave fear, tremendous
issues, but the turning-point itself may have
been passed in deliberation and quiet.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Choose from class reading&mdash;present or recent&mdash;some
passage in conversation. Discuss the traits exhibited
by the speakers. Formulate in a single statement the point
made by the remarks. Does the interest rise enough to make
the passage dramatic?</p>

<p>2. Several members of the class should read certain
passages from books, poems, etc. The class should consider
and discuss the characterization, interest, point, climax.</p>

<p>3. Read Chapters VI and VII of <i>Silas Marner</i> by George
Eliot. Are the characters well marked? Is the conversation
interesting in itself? Does the interest rise? Where does
the rise begin? Is there any suspense? Does the scene
conclude properly? If this were acted upon a stage would
any additional lines be necessary or desirable?</p>

<p>4. Read the last part of Chapter XI of <i>Silas Marner</i>.
What is the point?</p>

<p>5. Memorize this dialogue and deliver it before the class.
Did the point impress the class?</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Consider, discuss, and test passages from any book
which the members of the class know.</p>

<p>7. Present before the class passages from any of the
following:</p>

<p><b>Characters in Plays.</b> In acting regular plays you
may find it necessary to follow either of the preceding
methods of characterization. The conception of a
character may have to be supplied almost entirely by
some one outside the play. Or the dramatist may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>very careful to set down clearly and accurately the
traits, disposition, actions of the people in his plays.
In this second case the performer must try to carry out
every direction, every hint of the dramatist. In the
first case, he must search the lines of the play to glean
every slightest suggestion which will help him to carry
out the dramatist's intention. Famous actors of
characters in Shakespeare's plays can give a reason for
everything they show&mdash;at least, they should be able
to do so&mdash;and this foundation should be a compilation
of all the details supplied by the play itself, and stage
tradition of its productions.</p>

<p>In early plays there are practically no descriptions of
the characters. Questions about certain Shakespeare
characters will never be solved to the satisfaction of all
performers. For instance, how old is Hamlet in the
tragedy? How close to madness did the dramatist
expect actors to portray his actions? During Hamlet's
fencing match with Laertes in the last scene the
Queen says, "He's fat, and scant of breath." Was
she describing his size, or meaning that he was out of
fencing trim?</p>

<p>Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Julius Caesar a
detailed description of the appearance and manner of
acting of one of the chief characters of the tragedy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let me have men about me that are fat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<hr style='width: 25%;' />
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet if my name were liable to fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not know the man I should avoid<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a great observer, and he looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite through the deeds of men; he loves no plays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That could be mov'd to smile at any thing.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In <i>As You Like It</i> when the two girls are planning to
flee to the forest of Arden, Rosalind tells how she will
disguise herself and act as a man. This indicates to
the actress both costume and behavior for the remainder
of the comedy.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">Were it not better,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because that I am more than common tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I did suit me all points like a man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boar-spear in my hand; and&mdash;in my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many other mannish cowards have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That do outface it with their semblances.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In many cases Shakespeare clearly shows the performer
exactly how to carry out his ideas of the nature
of a man during part of the action. One of the plainest
instances of this kind of instruction is in <i>Macbeth</i>. The
ambitious thane's wife is urging him on to murder his
king. Her advice gives the directions for the following
scenes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i13">O never<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall sun that morrow see!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your face, my thane, is as a book where men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May read strange matters. To beguile the time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But be the serpent under't. He that's coming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be provided for: and you shall put<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This night's great business into my dispatch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shall to all our nights and days to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Modern dramatists are likely to be much more careful
in giving advice about characterization. They insert
a large number of stage directions covering this matter.
Speed of delivery, tone and inflection, as well as underlying
feeling and emotion are minutely indicated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">DUCHESS OF BERWICK</span></p>

<p>Agatha, you say the most silly things possible.</p></div>

<p><b>Descriptions of Characters.</b> In addition to definite
directions at special times during the course of the
dialogue, modern writers of plays describe each character
quite fully at his first entrance into the action.
This gives the delineator of each r&ocirc;le a working basis
for his guidance. Such directions carefully followed
out assure the tone for the whole cast. They keep a
subordinate part always in the proper relation to all
others. They make certain the impression of the
whole story as a consistent artistic development. They
prevent misunderstandings about the author's aim.
They provide that every character shall appear to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>swayed by natural motives. They remove from the
performance all suggestions of unregulated caprice.</p>

<p>Dramatists vary in the exactness and minuteness
of such descriptive character sketches, but even the
shortest and most general is necessary to the proper
appreciation of every play, even if it is being merely
read. When a student is assimilating a r&ocirc;le for
rehearsing or acting, these additions of the author are
as important as the lines themselves.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>Analyze the following. Discuss the suitability of various
members of the class for each part. Which details do you
think least essential?</p>

<p>1. He is a tall, thin, gaunt, withered, domineering man of
sixty. When excited or angry he drops into dialect, but
otherwise his speech, though flat, is fairly accurate. He sits
in an arm-chair by the empty hearth working calculations
in a small shiny black notebook, which he carries about with
him everywhere, in a side pocket.</p>

<p>2. When the curtain rises a man is seen climbing over the
balcony. His hair is close cut; his shirt dirty and blood-stained.
He is followed by another man dressed like a sailor
with a blue cape, the hood drawn over his head. Moonlight.</p>

<p>3. Enter Dinah Kippen quickly, a dingy and defiant young
woman carrying a tablecloth. She is a nervous creature,
driven half-mad by the burden of her cares. Conceiving life,
necessarily, as a path to be traversed at high speed, whenever
she sees an obstacle in her way, whether in the physical or
in the moral sphere, she rushes at it furiously to remove it
or destroy it.</p>

<p>4. Mrs. Rhead, a woman of nearly sixty, is sitting on the
sofa, crocheting some lace, which is evidently destined to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>trim petticoats. Her hair is dressed in the style of 1840,
though her dress is of the 1860 period.</p>

<p>5. The song draws nearer and Patricia Carleon enters.
She is dark and slight, and has a dreamy expression. Though
she is artistically dressed, her hair is a little wild. She has a
broken branch of some flowering tree in her hand.</p>

<p>6. Enter a Neat-herd, followed by King Alfred, who is
miserably clad and shivering from cold; he carries a bow and a
few broken arrows. A log fire is burning smokily in a corner
of the hut.</p>

<p>7. Enter from the right Ito, the cynic philosopher, book
in hand.</p>

<p>8. The rising of the curtain discovers the two Miss
Wetherills&mdash;two sweet old ladies who have grown so much
alike it would be difficult for a stranger to tell the one from
the other. The hair of both is white, they are dressed much
alike, both in some soft lavender colored material, mixed with
soft lace.</p>

<p>9. Newte is a cheerful person, attractively dressed in
clothes suggestive of a successful follower of horse races. He
carries a white pot hat and tasselled cane. His gloves are
large and bright. He is smoking an enormous cigar.</p>

<p>10. She is young, slender, graceful; her yellow hair is in
disorder, her face the color of ruddy gold, her teeth white
as the bones of the cuttle-fish, her eyes humid and sea-green,
her neck long and thin, with a necklace of shells about it;
in her whole person something inexpressibly fresh and
glancing, which makes one think of a creature impregnated
with sea-salt dipped in the moving waters, coming out of
the hiding-places of the rocks. Her petticoat of striped
white and blue, torn and discolored, falls only just below the
knees, leaving her legs bare; her bluish apron drips and
smells of the brine like a filter; and her bare feet in contrast
with the brown color that the sun has given her flesh, are
singularly pallid, like the roots of aquatic plants. And her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>voice is limpid and childish; and some of the words that she
speaks seem to light up her ingenuous face with a mysterious
happiness.</p>

<p><b>Studying Plays.</b> In nearly every grade of school and
college, plays are either read or studied. The usual
method of study is to read the lines of the play in rotation
about the class, stopping at times for explanations,
definitions, impressions, general discussions. Such
minute analysis may extend to the preparation of outlines
and diagrams. The methods used to get pupils
to know plays are almost as varied as teachers. After
such analytical study has been pursued it is always a
stimulating exercise to get another impression of the
play&mdash;not as mere poetry or literature, but as acted
drama.</p>

<p>This may be accomplished in a short time by very
simple means. Pupils should memorize certain portions
and then recite them before the class. Neither
costumes nor scenery will be required. All the members
of the class have in their minds the appearances of
the surroundings and the persons. What they need
is to <i>hear</i> the speeches the dramatist put into the hearts
and mouths of his characters.</p>

<p>The best presentation would be the delivery of the
entire play running through some four or five class
periods. If so much time cannot be allotted to this,
only certain scenes need be delivered. The teacher
might assign the most significant ones to groups of
pupils, allowing each group to arrange for rehearsals
before appearing before the class. In some classes the
pupils may be trusted to arrange the entire distribution
of scenes and r&ocirc;les. When their preliminary planning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>has been finished, they should hand to the teacher a
schedule of scenes and participants.</p>

<p>Whenever a play is read or studied, pupils will be
attracted more by some passages than by others. A
teacher may dispense with all assignments. The pupils
could be directed merely to arrange their own groups,
choose the scenes they want to offer, and to prepare as
they decide. In such a voluntary association some
members of the class might be uninvited to speak with
any group. These then might find their material in
prologue, epilogue, chorus, soliloquy, or inserted songs.
Nearly every play contains long passages requiring for
their effect no second speaker. Shakespeare's plays
contain much such material. All the songs from a play
would constitute a delightful offering. Nothing in all
the acted portion of <i>Henry V</i> is any better than the
stirring speeches of the Chorus. <i>Hamlet</i> has three
great soliloquies for boys. <i>Macbeth</i> contains the sleepwalking
scene for girls. Milton's <i>Comus</i> is made up of
beautiful poetic passages. Every drama studied or read
for school contains enough for every member of a class.</p>

<p>Some pupils may object that unless an exact preliminary
assignment is made, two or more groups may
choose the same scene. Such a probable happening,
far from being a disadvantage to be avoided, is a decided
advantage worthy of being purposely attempted. Could
anything be more stimulating than to see and hear two
different casts interpret a dramatic situation? Each
would try to do better than the other. Each would be
different in places. From a comparison the audience
and performers would have all the more light thrown
upon what they considered quite familiar.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be a mistake to have five quartettes repeat
the same scene over and over again. Yet if twenty
pupils had unconsciously so chosen, three presentations
might be offered for discriminating observation. Then
some other portion could be inserted and later the first
scene could be gone through twice.</p>

<p><b>Assigning R&ocirc;les.</b> Teacher and pupils should endeavor
to secure variety of interest in r&ocirc;les. At first,
assignments are likely to be determined by apparent
fitness. The quiet boy is not required to play the part
of the braggart. The retiring girl is not expected to
impersonate the shrew. In one or two appearances it
may be a good thing to keep in mind natural aptitude.</p>

<p>Then there should be a departure from this system.
Educational development comes not only from doing
what you are best able to do, but from developing the
less-marked phases of your disposition and character.
The opposite practice should be followed, at least once.
Let the prominent class member assume a r&ocirc;le of subdued
personality. Let the timid take the lead. Induce
the silent to deliver the majority of the speeches. You
will be amazed frequently to behold the best delineations
springing from such assignments.</p>

<p>Such rehearsing of a play already studied should
terminate the minute analysis in order to show the
material for what it is&mdash;actable drama. It will vivify
the play again, and make the characters live in your memory
as mere reading never will. You will see the moving
people, the grouped situations, the developed story,
the impressive climax, and the satisfying conclusion.</p>

<p>In dealing with scenes from a long play&mdash;whether
linked or disconnected&mdash;pupils will always have a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>feeling of incompleteness. In a full-length play no
situation is complete in itself. It is part of a longer
series of events. It may finish one part of the action,
but it usually merely carries forward the plot, passing
on the complication to subsequent situations.</p>

<p><b>Short Plays.</b> To deal with finished products
should be the next endeavor. There are thousands
of short plays suitable for class presentation in an informal
manner. Most of them do not require intensive
study, as does a great Greek or English drama, so their
preparation may go on entirely outside the classroom.
It should be frankly admitted that the exercises
of delivering lines "in character" as here described is
not acting or producing the play. That will come later.
These preliminary exercises&mdash;many or few, painstaking
or sketchy&mdash;are processes of training pupils
to speak clearly, interestingly, forcefully, in the imagined
character of some other person. The pupil
must not wrongly believe that he is acting.</p>

<p>Though the delivery of a complete short play may
seem like a performance, both participants and audience
must not think of it so. It is class exercise, subject
to criticism, comment, improvement, exactly as
all other class recitations are.</p>

<p>Since the entire class has not had the chance to
become familiar with all the short plays to be presented,
some one should give an introductory account of the
time and place of action. There might be added any
necessary comments upon the characters. The cast
of characters should be written upon the board.</p>

<p>This exercise should be exactly like the preceding,
except that it adds the elements of developing the plot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>of the play, creating suspense, impressing the climax,
and satisfactorily rounding off the play. In order to
accomplish these important effects the participants
will soon discover that they must agree upon certain
details to be made most significant. This will lead
to discussions about how to make these points stand
out. In the concerted attempt to give proper emphasis
to some line late in the play it will be found necessary
to suppress a possible emphasis of some line early in
the action. To reinforce a trait of some person,
another character may have to be made more self-assertive.</p>

<p>To secure this unified effect which every play should
make the persons involved will have to consider carefully
every detail in lines and stage directions, fully
agree upon what impression they must strive for, then
heartily co&ouml;perate in attaining it. They must forget
themselves to remember always that "the play's the
thing."</p>

<p>The following list will suggest short plays suitable for
informal classroom training in dramatics. Most of
these are also general enough in their appeal to serve
for regular production upon a stage before a miscellaneous
audience.</p>

<p><b>Producing Plays.</b> Any class or organization which
has followed the various forms of dramatics outlined
thus far in this chapter will find it an easy matter to
succeed in the production of a play before an audience.</p>

<p><b>The Play.</b> The first thing to decide upon is the play
itself. This choice should be made as far in advance
of performance as is possible. Most of the work of
producing a play is in adequate preparation. Up to
this time audiences have been members of the class,
or small groups with kindly dispositions and forbearing
sympathies. A general audience is more critical. It
will be led to like or dislike according to the degree its
interest is aroused and held. It will be friendly, but
more exacting. The suitability of the play for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>audience must be regarded. A comedy by Shakespeare
which delights and impresses both performers
and audience is much more stimulating and educating
than a Greek tragedy which bores them.</p>

<p><b>The Stage.</b> The second determining factor is the
stage. What is its size? What is its equipment?
Some plays require large stages; others fit smaller ones
better. A large stage may be made small, but it is
impossible to stretch a small one.</p>

<p>Equipment for a school stage need not be elaborate.
Artistic ingenuity will do more than reckless expenditure.
The simplest devices can be made to produce
the best effects. The lighting system should admit of
easy modification. For example, it should be possible
to place lights in various positions for different effects.
It should be possible to get much illumination or little.</p>

<p><b>Scenery.</b> No scenery should be built when the stage
is first erected. If a regular scene painter furnishes
the conventional exterior, interior, and woodland
scenery, the stage equipment is almost ruined for all
time. It is ridiculous that a lecturer, a musician, a
school principal, and a student speaker, should appear
before audiences in the same scenery representing a
park or an elaborate drawing-room. The first furnishings
for a stage should be a set of beautiful draped curtains.
These can be used, not only for such undramatic
purposes as those just listed, but for a great many
plays as well.</p>

<p>No scenery should be provided until the first play is
to be presented. Certain plays can be adequately
acted before screens arranged differently and colored
differently for changes. When scenery must be built
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>it should be strongly built as professional scenery is.
It should also be planned for future possible manipulation.
Every director of school dramatics knows the
delight of utilizing the same material over and over
again. Here is one instance. An interior set, neutral
in tones and with no marked characteristics of style
and period, was built to serve in Acts I and V of <i>A
Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. Hangings, furniture,
costumes gave it the proper appearance. Later it was
used in <i>Ulysses</i>. It has also housed Moli&egrave;re's <i>Doctor
in Spite of Himself</i> (<i>Le Medecin Malgr&eacute; Lui</i>) and <i>The
Wealthy Upstart</i> (<i>Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i>), Carrion
and Aza's <i>Zarag&uuml;eta</i>, Sudermann's <i>The Far-Away
Princess</i>, Houghton's <i>The Dear Departed</i>. The wooden
frames on the rear side were painted black, the canvas
panels tan, to serve in <i>Twelfth Night</i> for the drinking
scene, Act II, scene 3. With Greek shields upon the
walls it later pictured the first scene of <i>The Comedy
of Errors</i>. With colorful border designs attached and
oriental furniture it set a Chinese play.</p>

<p>A definite series of dimensions should be decided
upon, and all scenery should be built in relation to
units of these sizes. As a result of this, combinations
otherwise impossible can be made. Beginners should
avoid putting anything permanent upon a stage. The
best stage is merely space upon which beautiful pictures
may be produced. Beware of adopting much lauded
"new features" such as cycloramas, horizonts, until
you are assured you need them and can actually use
them. In most cases it is wise to consult some one
with experience.</p>

<p>In considering plays for presentation you will have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>to think of whether your performers and your stage
will permit of convincing production. Remembering
that suggestion is often better than realism, and knowing
that beautiful curtains and colored screens are
more delightful to gaze upon than cheap-looking canvas
and paint, and knowing that action and costume
produce telling effects, decide what the stage would
have to do for the following scenes.</p>


<p>EXERCISES</p>

<p>1. Read scene 2 of <i>Comus</i> by Milton. Should the entire
masque be acted out-of-doors? If presented on an indoors
stage what should the setting be? Inside the palace of
Comus? How then do the Brothers get in? How do
Sabrina and her Nymphs arise? From a pool, a fountain?
Might the stage show an exterior? Would the palace be
on one side? The edge of the woods on the other? Would
the banks of the river be at the rear? Would such an arrangement
make entrances, exits, acting, effective? Explain
all your opinions.</p>

<p>Read one of the following. Devise a stage setting for
it. Describe it fully. If you can, make a sketch in black
and white or in color, showing it as it would appear to the
audience. Or make a working plan, showing every detail.
Or construct a small model of the set, making the parts so
that they will stand. Or place them in a box to reproduce
the stage. Use one-half inch to the foot.</p>

<p>2. <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, scene 1. Interior? Exterior?
Color? Lighting?</p>

<p>3. <i>Hamlet</i>, Act I, scene 5. Castle battlements? A graveyard?
Open space in country some distance from castle?</p>

<p>4. <i>Comus</i>, scene 3.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Tempest</i>, Act I, scene 1.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act II, scene 3.</p>

<p>7. <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act I, scene I.</p>

<p>8. <i>Julius Caesar</i>, Act III, scene 2.</p>

<p>9. In a long, high-vaulted room, looking out upon a Roman
garden where the cypresses rise in narrowing shafts from
thickets of oleander and myrtle, is seated a company of men
and women, feasting.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">William Sharp</span>: <i>The Lute-Player</i></p>

<p>10. A room, half drawing-room, half study, in Lewis
Davenant's house in Rockminister. Furniture eighteenth
century, pictures, china in glass cases. An April afternoon
in 1860.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">George Moore</span>: <i>Elizabeth Cooper</i></p>

<p>11. An Island off the West of Ireland. Cottage kitchen,
with nets, oil-skins, spinning wheel, some new boards standing
by the wall, etc.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">J.m. Synge</span>: <i>Riders to the Sea</i></p>

<p>12. Loud music. After which the Scene is discovered,
being a Laboratory or Alchemist's work-house. Vulcan looking
at the registers, while a Cyclope, tending the fire, to the
cornets began to sing.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>: <i>Mercury Vindicated</i></p>

<p>13. Rather an awesome picture it is with the cold blue
river and the great black cliffs and the blacker cypresses that
grow along its banks. There are signs of a trodden slope
and a ferry, and there's a rough old wooden shelter where
passengers can wait; a bell hung on the top with which they
call the ferryman.</p>

<p class="quotdate"><span class="smcap">Calthrop and Barker</span>: <i>The Harlequinade</i></p>

<p>Long before any play is produced there should be
made a sketch or plan showing the stage settings. If
it is in color it will suggest the appearance of the actual
stage. One important point is to be noted. Your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>sketch or model is merely a miniature of the real thing.
If you have a splotch of glaring color only an inch
long it will appear in the full-size setting about two
feet long. A seemingly flat surface three by five inches
in the design will come out six by ten feet behind the
footlights.</p>

<p><b>Casting the Play.</b> When the play is selected, the
r&ocirc;les must be cast. To select the performers, one of
many different methods may be followed. The instructor
of the class or the director of the production
may assign parts to individuals. When this person
knows the requirements of the r&ocirc;les and the abilities of
the members, this method always saves time and
effort. By placing all the responsibility upon one
person it emphasizes care in choosing to secure best
results. At times a committee may do the casting.
Such a method prevents personal prejudice and immature
judgments from operating. It splits responsibility
and requires more time than the first method.
It is an excellent method for seconding the opinions
of a director who does not know very well the applicants
for parts. The third method is by "try-outs."
In this the applicants show their ability. This
may be done by speaking or reciting before an audience,
a committee, or the director. It may consist of acting
some r&ocirc;le. It may be the delivery of lines from the
play to be acted. It may be in a "cast reading" in
which persons stand about the stage or room and read
the lines of characters in the play. If there are three
or four applicants for one part, each is given a chance
to act some scene. In this manner all the r&ocirc;les are
filled.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two drawbacks to this scheme which is
the fairest which can be devised. It consumes a
great deal of time. Some member of the class or organization
best fitted to play a r&ocirc;le may not feel disposed
to try for it. Manifestly he should be the one selected.
But it appears unfair to disregard the three boys who
have made the effort while he has done nothing. Yet
every r&ocirc;le should be acted in the very best manner.
For the play's sake, the best actor should be assigned
the part. A pupil may try for a part for which he is
not at all suited, while he could fill another r&ocirc;le
better than any one who strives to get it.</p>

<p>In a class which has been trained in public speaking
or dramatics as this book suggests, it should be no
difficult task to cast any play, whether full-length or
one act. Performers must always be chosen because
of the possible development of their latent abilities
rather than for assured attainments.</p>

<p>These qualities must be sought for in performers of
roles&mdash;obedience, dependableness, mobility, patience,
endurance.</p>

<p><b>Rehearsing</b>. A worthy play which is well cast is
an assured success before its first rehearsal.</p>

<p>The entire group should first study the whole play
under the director's comment. It is best to have each
actor read his own part. The behavior of a minor
character in the second act may depend upon a speech
in the first. The person playing that r&ocirc;le must seize
upon that hint for his own interpretation.</p>

<p>It might be a good thing to have every person "letter
perfect," that is, know all his speeches, at the first
rehearsal. Practically, this never occurs. Reading
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>from the book or the manuscript, a performer "walks
through" his part, getting at the same time an idea of
where he is to stand, how to move, how to speak, what
to do, where to enter, when to cross the stage. All
such directions he should jot down upon his part. Then
memorizing the lines will fix these stage directions in
his mind. He will be assimilating at the same time
lines and "business." "Business" on the stage is
everything done by a character except speaking lines.</p>

<p>At all rehearsals the director is in absolute charge.
His word is final law. This does not mean that members
of the cast may not discuss things with him, and
suggest details and additions. They must be careful
to choose a proper time to do such things. They
should never argue, but follow directions. Time outside
rehearsals may be devoted to clearing up points.
Of course an actor should never lose his temper.
Neither should the director. Both of these bits of
advice are frequently almost beyond observation of
living human beings. Yet they are the rules.</p>

<p>Rehearsals should be frequent rather than long.
Acts should be rehearsed separately. Frequently only
separate portions should be repeated. Combinations
should be made so as not to keep during long waits
characters with only a few words. Early portions will
have to be repeated more frequently than later ones
to allow the actors to get into their characterizations.
Tense, romantic, sentimental, comic scenes may have
to be rehearsed privately until they are quite good
enough to interest other members of the cast.</p>

<p>The time for preparation will depend upon general
ability of the cast, previous training, the kind of play,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>the amount of leisure for study and rehearsing. In
most schools a full-length play may be crowded into
four weeks. Six or seven weeks are a better allowance.</p>

<p>During first rehearsals changes and corrections
should be made when needed. Interruptions should
be frequent. Later there should be no interruptions.
Comments should be made at the end of a scene and embodied
in an immediate repetition to fix the change in the
actors' minds. Other modifications should be announced
before rehearsal, and embodied in the acting that day.</p>

<p>The acting should be ready for an audience a week
before the date set for the performance. During the
last rehearsals, early acts should be recalled and repeated
in connection with later ones, so that time and
endurance may be counted and estimated. During
these days rehearsals must go forward without any attention
from the director. He must be giving all his
attention to setting, lighting, costumes, properties,
furniture, and the thousand and one other details
which make play producing the discouraging yet
fascinating occupation it is. Such repetition without
constant direction will develop a sense of independence
and co&ouml;peration in the actors and assistants which will
show in the enthusiasm and ease of the performance.
Stage hands and all other assistants must be trained
to the same degree of reliability as the hero and heroine.
Nothing can be left to chance. Nothing can be unprovided
until the last minute. The dress rehearsal
must be exactly like a performance, except that the
audience is not present, or if present, is a different one.
In schools, an audience at the dress rehearsal is usually
a help to the amateur performers.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Results</b>. A performance based on such principles
and training as here suggested should be successful from
every point of view.</p>

<p>The benefits to the participants are many. They
include strengthening of the power to memorize, widening
of the imagination through interpretation of character,
familiarity with a work of art, training in poise,
utilization of speaking ability, awakening of self-confidence,
and participation in a worthy co&ouml;perative
effort.</p>

<p>In a broader sense such interest in good, acted plays
is an intellectual stimulus. As better plays are more
and more effectively presented the quality of play
production in schools will be improved, and both
pupils and communities will know more and more of
the world's great dramatic literature.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
